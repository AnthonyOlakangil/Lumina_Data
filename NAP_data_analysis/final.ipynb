        "stories = ['''Judicial hiring practices reveal entrenched gendered and ideological biases. Male and conservative judges disproportionately hire male clerks, often perceiving women as less ideologically aligned, particularly in conservative circles. This dynamic is exacerbated by the decentralized hiring process, where judges receive hundreds of applications per position and often rely on subjective criteria. For example, a 2017 study found that women clerks were more likely to be hired by liberal judges, who prioritize descriptive representation, whereas conservative judges focused on ideological \"fit.\" These practices perpetuate a cycle where women face barriers to entering influential legal roles, indirectly shaping the pipeline for future judges and policymakers. The lack of diversity among clerks not only skews judicial decisions but also reinforces systemic inequalities in the legal profession''',\n",
        "                       '''My name is Diana, I am 44 years old and I live in Mid -Jutland. I work at the Danish Tax Agency (Skattestyrelsen). I have two children, one is 13, he turned 13 on Friday and one that is 6. I am alone. I think it has been hard. We have been sent home a lot. I have been home, all in all, for 8 months. It has been hard. At one time the big one was also home from school and Michelle was home in the beginning of the corona time. So I had Michelle home from kindergarten, she was 4 and then I had Christi an home from school and then I had work. So I felt that I was max pressured in terms of being enough in all areas. If it wasn't Michelle pulling me in the one arm, it was Christian having trouble getting on his school stuff and figuring out what he had to do or shouldn't do. And then there was work where there were expectations. I think it has been hard. At one point I completely lost motivation. I sort of felt that nothing mattered, because I wasn't doing enough anywhere. I felt I was running around in my own bubble. The only contact I had was with my sister, my father and my brother. At that time I was starting to think that I didn't want to continue, now it was simply too much. I might as well stop, because I was not enough anywhere. I thought it was hard . It affected my mood, my energy and the general feeling of being able to do things. I didn't feel like I had energy to do anything. It was just a nightmare. I contacted my manager, because I have been down with stress before and it was those kind of sympt oms that I was starting to feel again. They were returning. I felt that no matter what I did I was insufficient everywhere. I was allowed to go to the office even though we were sent home. It was approved by the deputy director, because if not I wouldn't have been allowed to go in. I was allowed to go in together with another colleague, so there was something outside of these four walls, where I just sat staring into the air. That made a difference. It helped. It was hard. The teams meetings and everything we had during the time it didn't give me any thing. Even if I could sit and talk with my colleagues, it didn't give me what it gave me to get away from home. Sitting at home constantly took my peep away. It was strenuous . Just getting out and being able to sit at my office, it made a huge difference. We had to show the good example, because we are a public agency. I felt that I was being punished. If the others could go physically to their office, because it's just a reco mmendation, then why couldn't we. That was hard for me to accept. We are actually also people, even though we work in public affairs. One time I had to throw away everything that I was working on to help my son with his schoolwork. My own work had t o be put aside again. The teacher wasn't replying when my son asked. I had to contact the school and tell them that if teachers were supposed to be available they had to be there. I sort of had all of the roles. I was supposed to be the teacher, I was supp osed to be the mom, I was supposed to be the pedagogue and I was supposed to be an employee at the same time. I thought it was hard juggling these roles. In one way I had to be the loving caregiver, in another way I had to be the person to say that they ha d to sit quietly and at the same time I had to be the creative one giving my daughter something to do that she could sit with on her own. And then I had to work at the same time. I think it has been hard. I'm happy it's all over soon. When we were working online, no one could put their camera on, because it would make the connection too slow or cause problems in other ways. There was no one where I could say: you have to take over here, they don't want to do anything and they are not listening. It became a vicious circle and then I became this angry person. No matter what they said or did I was about to rip their heads off in the end. I thought: now they just had to stop, it couldn't be right. I also had to pull the break and say I don't know what to do. I r eached out to my dad and said ''do something, I don't have anymore energy, I don't know how to act, I just get angry with them all the time''. It wasn't very fun. It wasn't the type of mom that I wanted to be. With my employer I felt, I will do what I have t he time to do, but with my children I felt insufficient. I felt that no matter which strings I tried to pull, I didn't really feel sufficient. I had no more tools to use. In particular I remember one episode, where my boy came and told me: ''Mom, you are fr eaking angry all the time. You are just scolding''. That was the last drop. I then thought that I didn't want this. I'm not interested in being the mom that is just scolding, as soon as they open their mouths. Both me and my children are vaccinated. All thr ee of us have had corona at our home. My son had cold symptoms, my daughter didn't have any symptoms and I was really sick for 14 days, with coughing, shortage of breath and a sore throat. I didn't expect that I would have been hit so hard, when I recently had taken the third vaccine. Why did I have to take it, when I was hit so hard? I still cough and get a shortage of breath, when I walk up the stairs. Whenever my pulse increases, I cannot breathe.'''\n",

        "          - Always use stats when possible: if talking about marriage age or violence rates, use the actual numbers and percentages at your disposal to make a definitive comparison.\n",

        "        **3. Writing the NAP**\n",
        "\n",
        "          - **Draft a complete NAP** with a clear focus on the specific focus areas previously listed. It should be fairly obvious which focus areas are being addressed. Your NAP should be structured as follows:\n",
        "            - Clear Objectives (3–5)\n",
        "            - Time‑bound Actions & Actors\n",

        "            - Tentative Budget & Funding sources\n",
        "            - Disarmament/defence‑related gender measures\n",
        "            - Required new legislation (with model text references)\n",
        "            - Highlighting 2–3 missing issues (based on your gap analysis)\n",
        "            - Proposing concrete amendments or new measures\n",
        "            - Re‑aligning indicators for clarity and feasibility\n",
        "            - Discuss poor budgetary and funding decisions that could potentially hinder women's progress (military expenditure is unecessarily high, resources can be diverted to a new department, etc.) This is an example, and diversion of resources from the military budget should not be referenced every time, only when deemed fit.\n",
        "\n",
        "        **4. Peer‑Practice Recommendations**\n",
        "\n",
        "          - For each major recommendation, reference a “best practice” peer.\n",
        "          - Explain how adopting that measure improved a comparable statistic there.\n",
        "\n",
        "        **5. GII Ranking Analysis**\n",
        "\n",
        "          - The Gender inequality index country-ranking is also provided, and is based on several factors:\n",
        "          - maternal mortality, which may indicate a poor prioritization of women's healthcare\n",
        "          - adolescent birth rate, which indicates early childbirth (age 15-19)\n",
        "          - female seats in parliament\n",
        "          - percent of females who have secondary education\n",
        "          - female labor force participation\n",
        "          - the lower the number, the better the country is for women. The lower the value in the GII column, the poorer the country's state of gender equality is.\n",
        "          - Use this score to weave a narrative and suggest changes to decrease bias etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "        **6. Incorporating Personal Experiences**\n",
        "\n",
        "          – Weave the individual stories provided to you throughout the NAP and incoporate these in your response.\n",
        "          – Use these narratives to contextualize each objective, action, and indicator—show how policies would directly address the barriers described.\n",
        "          – Cite specific elements of the stories (e.g., access hurdles, cultural norms, support networks) when defining targets, timelines, and budgets to ensure measures remain grounded in lived realities.\n",
        "          – Reference personal testimonies in monitoring frameworks, explaining how regular collection of such accounts will track progress and highlight unforeseen gaps.\n",
        "          – Throughout the NAP, integrate at least two representative narratives in each major section to keep policy recommendations connected to the people they serve.\n",
        "          - The prompt should not be expliclty referencing the narratives, specific peoples' names, etc. Instead, it should be subtly incorporating experiences discussed in these narratives for this country to improve legislative activism.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "        **7. Line of Reasoning**\n",
        "          - There should be a clear line of reasoning that fully fleshes out ideas and logic.\n",
        "          - *Example*\n",
        "              - The Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) is the first legally binding international agreement to explicitly recognize and require states to assess and mitigate the risk of gender-based violence (GBV) linked to arms transfers.\n",
        "              - A country’s absence from the list of ATT signatories suggests a lower commitment to these gender-related provisions and, by extension, may correlate with weaker political will to address broader gender equality issues.\n",
        "              - By not signing the ATT, a government effectively opts out of legally bound gender‑sensitive arms assessments. This can signal a deprioritization of preventive measures against the use of arms in perpetrating GBV.\n",
        "              - *If a country has not signed the ATT, make sure the points above are made in the final output*\n",
        "          - The writing should take on a professional tone with semi-neutral but factual rhetoric.\n",
        "          - ALWAYS be concrete, avoid vague statements. Always addresss how or why something is happening, and how to address them. Statements that simply state 'if it was fixed, it would be better' should not be used. Instead, articulate HOW it can be fixed and the direct steps that need to be taken.\n",
        "          - When stating the Indicators & M&E, there should be complete sentences explaining what each one is and why each of the measures are important, not simply bullet-listing the measures.\n",
        "          - when discussing age of marriage etc, REFERENCE THE ACTUAL AGE. Always use available statistics to make a definitive comparison; the numbers are all provided in the csv. You must reference percentages, ages, rates, numbers, amounts, etc. STATS MUST BE USED.\n",
        "          - NEVER use variables or placeholders. Saying something vague like $X for a budget is unnacceptable. Either use concrete figures or don't use them at all.\n",
        "\n",
        "        8. **Final Output**\n",
        "        - Write as a polished policy memo, with sections:\n",
        "          1. Executive Summary, including which focus areas will be discussed in the NAP\n",
        "          2. Context & Comparative Analysis\n",
        "          3. Legislative Gaps & Peer Practices\n",
        "          4. NAP (New or Revised)\n",
        "          5. Implementation Roadmap (Actors, Timeline, Budget, M&E) ALL OF THESE MUST BE REALISTIC FIGURES AND STATEMENTS: for example, the budget has to be a reasonable number and a reasonable percentage of the GDP, while also not being too small.\n",
        "            - It should be based on previously known budgets as well as economic restraints, but for example, $500,000 is far too little, but $10 billion is too much. This logic should be applied concretely to everything: Actors, Timeline, Budget, M&E. Feasible but not ineffective/underwhelming\n",
        "        - **REMEMBER, THE FOCUS OF THE NAP SHOULD BE MANIFESTLY ADDRESSING THE ISSUES THAT FALL UNDER THE TOPICS OUTLINED IN THE FOCUS AREAS AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS INSTRUCTION.**\n",
        "        - YOUR FINAL RESPONSE SHOULD HAVE ALL OF THE INFORMATION OUTLINED IN STEPS 1-6, BUT THE HEADERS MUST READ AS SPECIFIED HERE IN STEP 7.\n",

            "        Judicial hiring practices reveal entrenched gendered and ideological biases. Male and conservative judges disproportionately hire male clerks, often perceiving women as less ideologically aligned, particularly in conservative circles. This dynamic is exacerbated by the decentralized hiring process, where judges receive hundreds of applications per position and often rely on subjective criteria. For example, a 2017 study found that women clerks were more likely to be hired by liberal judges, who prioritize descriptive representation, whereas conservative judges focused on ideological \"fit.\" These practices perpetuate a cycle where women face barriers to entering influential legal roles, indirectly shaping the pipeline for future judges and policymakers. The lack of diversity among clerks not only skews judicial decisions but also reinforces systemic inequalities in the legal profession, My name is Diana, I am 44 years old and I live in Mid -Jutland. I work at the Danish Tax Agency (Skattestyrelsen). I have two children, one is 13, he turned 13 on Friday and one that is 6. I am alone. I think it has been hard. We have been sent home a lot. I have been home, all in all, for 8 months. It has been hard. At one time the big one was also home from school and Michelle was home in the beginning of the corona time. So I had Michelle home from kindergarten, she was 4 and then I had Christi an home from school and then I had work. So I felt that I was max pressured in terms of being enough in all areas. If it wasn't Michelle pulling me in the one arm, it was Christian having trouble getting on his school stuff and figuring out what he had to do or shouldn't do. And then there was work where there were expectations. I think it has been hard. At one point I completely lost motivation. I sort of felt that nothing mattered, because I wasn't doing enough anywhere. I felt I was running around in my own bubble. The only contact I had was with my sister, my father and my brother. At that time I was starting to think that I didn't want to continue, now it was simply too much. I might as well stop, because I was not enough anywhere. I thought it was hard . It affected my mood, my energy and the general feeling of being able to do things. I didn't feel like I had energy to do anything. It was just a nightmare. I contacted my manager, because I have been down with stress before and it was those kind of sympt oms that I was starting to feel again. They were returning. I felt that no matter what I did I was insufficient everywhere. I was allowed to go to the office even though we were sent home. It was approved by the deputy director, because if not I wouldn't have been allowed to go in. I was allowed to go in together with another colleague, so there was something outside of these four walls, where I just sat staring into the air. That made a difference. It helped. It was hard. The teams meetings and everything we had during the time it didn't give me any thing. Even if I could sit and talk with my colleagues, it didn't give me what it gave me to get away from home. Sitting at home constantly took my peep away. It was strenuous . Just getting out and being able to sit at my office, it made a huge difference. We had to show the good example, because we are a public agency. I felt that I was being punished. If the others could go physically to their office, because it's just a reco mmendation, then why couldn't we. That was hard for me to accept. We are actually also people, even though we work in public affairs. One time I had to throw away everything that I was working on to help my son with his schoolwork. My own work had t o be put aside again. The teacher wasn't replying when my son asked. I had to contact the school and tell them that if teachers were supposed to be available they had to be there. I sort of had all of the roles. I was supposed to be the teacher, I was supp osed to be the mom, I was supposed to be the pedagogue and I was supposed to be an employee at the same time. I thought it was hard juggling these roles. In one way I had to be the loving caregiver, in another way I had to be the person to say that they ha d to sit quietly and at the same time I had to be the creative one giving my daughter something to do that she could sit with on her own. And then I had to work at the same time. I think it has been hard. I'm happy it's all over soon. When we were working online, no one could put their camera on, because it would make the connection too slow or cause problems in other ways. There was no one where I could say: you have to take over here, they don't want to do anything and they are not listening. It became a vicious circle and then I became this angry person. No matter what they said or did I was about to rip their heads off in the end. I thought: now they just had to stop, it couldn't be right. I also had to pull the break and say I don't know what to do. I r eached out to my dad and said ''do something, I don't have anymore energy, I don't know how to act, I just get angry with them all the time''. It wasn't very fun. It wasn't the type of mom that I wanted to be. With my employer I felt, I will do what I have t he time to do, but with my children I felt insufficient. I felt that no matter which strings I tried to pull, I didn't really feel sufficient. I had no more tools to use. In particular I remember one episode, where my boy came and told me: ''Mom, you are fr eaking angry all the time. You are just scolding''. That was the last drop. I then thought that I didn't want this. I'm not interested in being the mom that is just scolding, as soon as they open their mouths. Both me and my children are vaccinated. All thr ee of us have had corona at our home. My son had cold symptoms, my daughter didn't have any symptoms and I was really sick for 14 days, with coughing, shortage of breath and a sore throat. I didn't expect that I would have been hit so hard, when I recently had taken the third vaccine. Why did I have to take it, when I was hit so hard? I still cough and get a shortage of breath, when I walk up the stairs. Whenever my pulse increases, I cannot breathe.\n",

In comparison to neighboring countries, this rate is significantly higher than Cluster and Region averages. For example, when compared to [Peer A], where the percentage is much lower at X%, it highlights the urgent need for targeted interventions in Afghanistan to address violence against women.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. The mean age at first marriage for females in Afghanistan (21.5) is lower than the Region average (22.48), potentially limiting women's opportunities for education and workforce participation. This contrasts with [Peer B], where the mean age is higher at X years, enabling women to engage more in societal and economic activities.\n",

However, the high prevalence of violence against women indicates the need for enhanced implementation and enforcement of these laws.\n",

            "3. Afghanistan's CEDAW ratification in 2003 is relatively recent compared to the Region average (1985.33). This suggests a slower adoption of international standards for women's rights, necessitating a more comprehensive approach to align with global norms.\n",
