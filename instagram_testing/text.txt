Whenever I mentioned my job in finance, people automatically assumed my boss must be a man. Their assumptions left me feeling isolated and frustrated. I knew that behind the faade of a modern workplace, archaic ideas about gender still prevailed. Despite working hard and proving my expertise, these assumptions undermined my credibility. I began documenting these experienceseach time I was sidelined or misjudgedand used them as motivation to push for better representation and fair treatment. This narrative captures my struggle to have my skills recognized in an environment where gender bias still dictates perceptions, and how I continue to fight for a more equitable workplace.
