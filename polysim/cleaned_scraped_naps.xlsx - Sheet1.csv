Afghanistan,"Afghanistan adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2015, for the period 2015-2018 and 2019-2022, to be implemented in two phases. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which serves as the head of the Steering Committee that will work in collaboration with other government agencies, civil society, and international organisations for the NAP’s implementation and monitoring. The NAP was  developed to address the challenges women face in the aftermath of war and conflict in Afghanistan, and is organised under the primary pillars of UNSCR 1325: participation, protection, prevention, and relief and recovery. Nevertheless, the NAP does not address disarmament issues, nor does it connect the proliferation of weapons with women’s insecurity, despite the fact that the implementation of the NAP is being undertaken within the context of the ongoing conflict . Additionally, there have been numerous difficulties in terms of resourcing the implementation of the NAP. Afghanistan reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country provided the following updates, among others: Comparative analysis of year 2016-17 to 2018 shows that remarkable progress has been made towards adopting and implementing NAP for women, peace and security … Security situation has changed significantly for better in period at national and regional levels, finances and allocations of budgets are completed in 2017 for implementing the plan. Capacity building of points for NAP completed in 2017 with technical assistance from UNWOMEN. Provincial resourcing saw slow progress because of finalizing of national financing mechanism. However, 2017 Status Report on the Afghanistan’s National Action Plan shows considerable Policy coordination came through the formation of steering committees and their meetings on quarterly basis. (p. 81) The High Peace Council (HPC) reports in the 2017 Status Report on the Afghanistan’s National Action Plan on UNSCR 1325 that their five-year strategic plan center’s around women’s participation in peace, reconciliation and reintegration in Afghanistan. In addition to the achievements mentioned above, Ministry of Women’s Affairs (MoWA) reported that there is a roster of 66 women covering 34 provinces in Afghanistan. The women on the roster participated in peace negotiations with the armed opposition both in Afghanistan and abroad. (pp. 81-82). Afghanistan has experienced varying forms of armed conflict since the past five decades, including civil wars and the US invasion of the country in 2001. Under the Taliban regime , which lasted from 1996 until 2001, women were banned from participating in public life, including access to education, healthcare, and employment. While women made a number of gains after the collapse of the Taliban regime, women’s meaningful participation in the Afghan peace process, as well as not backsliding on human rights, including women’s rights, is of critical importance. During the 23 rounds of peace talks between 2005 and 2014, women were included at the peace table in only two occasions. Furthermore, the negotiating team that was announced after the November 2018 conference in Geneva had three women, but no civil society representatives. Women were excluded from the US-Taliban talks throughout 2019, as were issues of women’s rights, leading to widespread concern among Afghan women that their human rights would be compromised for the sake of an agreement. In 2020, there were four women among the 21-member government negotiating team in the intra-Afghan talks. In 2019, Afghanistan was among the top 15 countries in the world with the biggest increase in their military expenditure, with a 20% increase in its military spending. Additionally, in 2019, Afghanistan was among the top 30 largest importers of arms.",2003,,2020,227M,"NAP Development
The Steering Committee is the body responsible for the NAP development process where there is a civil society representative. In the drafting stage, civil society conducted several meetings with the Steering Committee and the Technical Working Group to review and provide substantive comments and inputs. No further detail is given to specify the nature of the role played by a civil society representative.
WILPF did not have a country section in Afghanistan at the time of the adoption of 2015 NAP and therefore was not involved in the development process of Afghanistan's NAP.
The development of the NAP was initiated in coordination with civil society, and conducted through the establishment of the following structures:
Steering Committee with the Minister of Foreign Affairs as the Chairperson Member;
Technical Working Group representatives from international organizations and foreign diplomatic missions in Kabul;
Drafting Committee;
Coordination Committee.
NAP Implementation
 While there is no clear reference on the mechanism for civil society involvement, the NAP text lists civil society as one of the agencies to be fully or partially responsible for conducting specific actions. For instance, under the Strategic Objective ""Enhancing Women’s meaningful participation in the reconciliation, negotiation, and re‐integration at all levels"", civil society organisations are assigned the action of ""Establish a national roaster of potential women negotiators from all 34 provinces"". 
The NAP is a government policy and a reflection of government’s commitments with regards to the implementation of UNSCR 1325. Lead implementing agencies are government agencies, ministries, structures and institutions, while civil society, media and the private sector play an important role as the supporting agencies.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
There is no clear reference for how civil society will be involved in the monitoring and evaluation process. However, the government recognises the important role of civil society as an independent oversight body for the successful implementation of the NAP.
A separate Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Plan is designed, which includes annual monitoring, mid-term (after two years) and final review (Evaluation) in the fourth year. The M&E Plan will include tracking and monitoring of financing for the NAP to ensure transparent and effective implementation, for which the Steering Committee is responsible. ","The NAP spans over two phases of four year period each, and the actions in the matrix section of the NAP are linked to specific time frames. The phase one will cover 2015‐2018 and phase two will cover 2019‐2022. Also, for each strategic objective, there is a time frame set to denote in which phase the objective actions should be achieved.","The Afghan NAP is organised under the main UNSCR1325 themes: Participation, Protection, Prevention and Relief and Recovery. Each theme has a number of strategic objectives distributed across specific areas of work. For instance, under participation, there are the following objectives distributed across Civil Service, Security and Peace and Reintegration:
Objective 1: Increased meaningful participation of women in the decision making and executive levels of the Civil Service, Security and Peace and Reintegration
Objective 2: Strengthening women’s active participation in national and provincial elections.
Under each of these objectives there is a number of strategic objectives followed by a number of specific action, expected results, indicators, reporting mechanism, time frame and implementing agencies.","Each Strategic Objective of the Afghan NAP includes a series of actions for practically achieving these goals. For instance, under the Prevention theme Strategic Objective 1: Protection of women through implementation and monitoring of EVAW law,anti‐human trafficking and abduction law, there are the following actions:
Develop and implement of a monitoring mechanism on implementation of EVAW law, anti-human trafficking and abduction law.
Strengthen the justice sector to effectively and efficiently address the VAW cases with special focus on prosecution office and courts.","The annual reporting by the lead agencies will be prepared on the basis of indicators, templates, activities and their specific responsibilities. For each objective, there is an assigned quantitative indicator. The NAP lists quantitative indicators to track the progress of objectives and activities. For instance, for strategic objective ""Increased awareness among all military personnel on how to protect women from violence"" the specific indicator is ""Number of military personnel briefed on how to protect women from sexual violence and number of commanders informed of their responsibility to protect women."" In total, there are 39 quantitative indicators listed in the NAP.","The Steering Committee has a central role in the monitoring and evaluation process for the NAP. separate Monitoring and Evaluation
(M&E) Plan is designed, which includes annual monitoring, mid‐term (after two years) and final review (Evaluation) in the fourth year. The M&E Plan will include tracking and monitoring of financing for the NAP to ensure transparent and effective implementation, for which the Steering Committee is responsible. The GIRoA recognizes the important role of civil society as an independent oversight body for the successful implementation of the NAP.","The Afghan NAP does not include an allocated or estimated budget and there are no other financial resource consideration references within the NAP. However, it does note that the absence of dedicated funding is a key concern for successful NAP implementation and accountability.When budgeting/costing the NAP, the Steering Committee should encourage national and international donors to commit to funding for the duration of the NAP.
Throughout the course of implementation attention should be focused on seeking and raising funds from multiple national and international sources. The Steering Committee should also work to increase the available funds to the NAP through the annual national government budget. The budget should also contain a contingency plan, and some margins for each expected budget line that will be used when limitations in funding occur. The NAP budget should be revised on an annual basis if needed and necessary adjustments should be made.
Also, under Relief and Recovery pillar, Objective 2: Adequate financial resources are available for activities related to women in emergency, the NAP stresses that analysis of national budget should be through a gender lens.","Afghanistan's NAP does not address disarmament issues, or connect the proliferation of weapons with women's insecurity."
Albania,"Albania adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2018 for the period 2018-2020 and its most recent for the period 2023-2027. The 2018 NAP was developed by a number of ministries, including the Ministries of Internal Affairs; Europe and Foreign Affairs; and Health and Social Protection, through a participatory approach that included consultations with the representatives of local authorities, Netherlands, Sweden, UN Women, OSCE, the European Union, and civil society organizations. The main objectives of the NAP are listed as improving policy documents and raising awareness on UNSCR 1325; increasing the participation of women in the field of security at home and abroad; establishing a regulatory framework and capacities that enable better protection and rehabilitation of women in the field of peace and security; and taking measures for better monitoring and reporting of Resolution 1325. Each objective has corresponding actions and indicators as well as including a detailed budget for implementation. Albania became a parliamentary republic in 1992 after four decades of communist rule. The most recent armed conflict in Albania’s history was the 1997 civil unrest, which ensued from the collapse of informal market institutions, known as pyramid schemes , that promised high-interest returns on investments. The unrest resulted in over 2,000 casualties as well as the overthrow of the government. The country’s protracted economic instability has had direct repercussions for women. Despite the fact that the country’s law recognizes women’s equal right to property and land ownership on paper, in 2018, only 8% of women in Albania owned land due to women’s marginalization in economic matters and lack of implementation of laws.",1994,20,2014,198M,"NAP Development
The drafting and developmental process for the NAP 1325 were provided by UN Women, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Delegation of the European Union to Albania, and The Coalition for Resolution 1325, which was established by civil society organisations (CSOs), funded by the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the UN Women ""Fund for Gender Equality” and implemented by the Association for Women with Social Problems (AWSP), and the Albanian Women’s Empowerment Network (AWEN). 
WILPF Albania did not participate in the development process of the first Albanian NAP.
The Government of Albania, the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MoIA), the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs (MoEFA), the Ministry of Defence (MoD), and the Ministry of Health and Social Protection (MoHSP), were the lead agencies in the development process of Albania's NAP. Encouragement, expertise and technical assistance for the preparation of the document were provided by the Kingdom of the Netherlands and Sweden, through the offices of their diplomatic missions in Albania.
NAP Implementation
Specialised civil society organisations will be present in the process of NAP implementation, including: Coalition for Resolution 1325, Operation 1325, Albanian Women’s Empowerment Network, Association for Women with Social Problems (AWSP), Faculty of Social Sciences at the University of Tirana, International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program, Local Security Government Units, and OSCE. Although civil society is being utilised throughout all of the objectives, they will mostly be involved in helping implement the activities outlined in Objective 1 on improving policy documents and raising awareness.
The Ministry of Defense (MoD), Ministry of Internal Affairs (MoIA), Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs (MoEFA) and the Ministry of Health and Social Protection (MoHSP) are listed as institutions responsible for implementing the various activities and objectives outlined in the Action Plan. 
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
The monitoring and evaluation will be carried out by several CSO’s specialised in Resolution 1325, such as Coalition for Resolution 1325, Operation 1325, Albanian Women’s Empowerment Network, and Association of Women in Security and Peace.
The MoEFA, MoIA, MoD, MOHSP, in cooperation with CSOs specialised in Resolution 1325 will establish a working group to review the current Action Plan and to draft future National Plans for Implementation of Resolution 1325. The MoEFA, MoIA, MoD will also draft monitoring reports by CSOs that support Resolution 1325.",The implementation period for the Albanian National Plan of Action is three years (2018-2020).,"The main objective of the NAP is the implementation and monitoring of Resolution 1325 through its promotion at every level: - local, through the prevention of any crisis situation and the strengthening of public awareness; - national, as part of the government program; - as well as international, through active involvement of the country in international activities. The main objectives are:
improving policy documents and raising awareness on Resolution 1325;
increasing the participation of women in the field of security at home and abroad;
establishing a regulatory framework and capacities that enable better protection and rehabilitation of women in the field of peace and security;
taking measures for better monitoring and reporting of Resolution 1325.","Each area of work has different actions assigned. For example, Objective 1.1: “Strengthen integration of a gender perspective through internal rules of procedure in national security and defense and participation in national and international  activities for the implementation of Resolution 1325”  includes several actions:
Review existing national security and defense rules of procedure on the integration of a gender perspective in line with Resolution 1325
Integrate a gender perspective into the international activities of the country and report on participation in these activities from a gender perspective
Conduct awareness-raising campaigns on women's rights and legislation on gender equality, violence, peace and security
Ensure increased representation of women officers at conferences/workshops and at the 7th Annual Conference of Women in Police as well as at the Annual Conference of the International Association of Women Police
Increase participation of women in Armed Forces structures in peacekeeping missions outside of the country, respectively, in conferences and seminars","Each strategic objective has a number of listed indicators. For example, Objective 2.1: “Inclusion of a gender balance in security sector activities” includes several indicators:
Number of women appointed to top positions;
Number of women added to relevant structures;
Number of women promoted; the level they had and the highest rank they were promoted to leadership positions within the security sector.
 ","Reports within the National Action Plan will be sent to the Integrated Policy Management Group. The annual report will then be submitted for approval to the Gender Equality Council. Those responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Action Plan will be the gender equality employees in the line ministries and institutions who collect data and identify gaps in information that is needed.
The Action Plan foresees publication of six-month progress reports and will provide support for the monitoring reports of the coalition of civil society organisations for Resolution 1325. At the policy level, monitoring of the NAP will be realised through an inter-institutional group that will be established with senior political representatives of the Ministry of Defense, Interior, Europe and Foreign Affairs, as well as the Ministry of Health and Social Protection, that holds meetings every 6 months. A representative of the CSO's  Coalition for Women, Peace and Security Agenda will participate in the meetings at the political level.
The monitoring and evaluation of the NAP will be carried out by an Implementation and Coordination Group (ICG), which will monitor, evaluate and report on the Action Plan. The ICG is comprised of technical representatives from line ministries, the institutions responsible for implementing this Action Plan, as well as a representative from the Coalition of civil society organisations for Resolution 1325 engaged in the women, peace and security agenda.
MoHSP will coordinate the data collection process from all gender officers at the institutions involved.","The Action Plan includes a  detailed budget with a breakdown of the cost of the implementation. The overall cost of implementing the NAP is 280,781,916 Lek. Depending on the type of activity, the Action Plan has specified sources of funding: the state budget will cover 83.3% of activities lined out in the NAP and 2.6% will be funded from donors who will fund the implementation of specific activities. Funding needs are at 14.1% of the total cost, or 39.7 million Lek. ","Albania's NAP does not discuss disarmament issues despite the recent conflicts that have affected women, children, and the civilian population in general."
Angola,"Angola adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2017 for the period 2017-2020. The NAP was developed by the Ministry for Family and Promotion of Women and the Ministry of National Defense and Interior. The NAP does not mention civil society involvement in the NAP development process, but does include civil society as a responsible entity for the implementation of certain objectives. The NAP has six overall objectives, including increasing women’s participation in peacebuilding processes; providing women and girls with training on peacebuilding processes, including on gender equality; promoting and protecting the rights of women and girls in conflict and post-conflict settings; raising awareness about the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) Agenda; and gender-responsive budgeting. Each objective has corresponding actions as well as an allocated budget. Angola reported on the implementation of its NAP and the WPS Agenda in its national reporting (available only in Portuguese) for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975, following a 15-year war for liberation. Women played a key role in the liberation war through the Organisation of Angolan Women and the Independent League for Angolan Women. Angola also experienced a civil war, which lasted from 1975 until 2002, and ended with the signing of the Luena Memorandum of Understanding . Women were excluded from the peace process, and despite the existence of a disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) program, women combatants were not provided with any benefits. These long-term armed conflicts have had a disproportionate impact on women, as women constitute approximately eighty percent of the internally displaced people. At the multilateral level, Angola most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2015-2016.",,,,,"NAP Development
Specific civil society organisations have not been explicitly mentioned as being involved in the development phase. Nevertheless, one of the many  objectives of the NAP is to increase the participation of civil society in the implementation of UNSCR 1325 by educating civil society on the WPS Agenda.
WILPF does not have a country section in Angola and therefore was not involved in the development process of Angola's NAP.
NAP Implementation
On an institutional level civil society are included as responsible agents for the implementation of the NAP. The Ministries that created the NAP along with other relevant Ministerial Departments are included as the main responsible actors for the implementation of the NAP. 
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
Civil society organisations in coordination with other entities will form part of the monitoring bodies of the implementation of the NAP. For certain activities, civil society organisations are included as participants in achieving certain objectives.",The implementation period of the Angolan NAP is four years (2017-2020).,"The objectives for the Angolan NAP are organised by the six pillars below:
Increase the participation of women and integrate the gender equality dimension into all phases of peacebuilding, including at all levels of decision-making;
Ensure women’s training and capacity building  for peacebuilding, gender equality, violence against women and other relevant aspects of UNSCR 1325 and 1820;

 ","For the policies recommended for the period of 2017-2020, the implementation of NAP will be based on a system of data collection, analysis and dissemination, in close coordination with the National Institute of Statistics. Regarding monitoring and evaluation, the Ministry of Family and Promotion of Women will be assisted by the Ministerial Departments of National Defense and Interior (Deputy Coordinators) and the other Ministerial Departments as social agents in order to ensure a greater intersectoral and interdisciplinary approach to implementing these policies.
The responsibility of coordinating the central and local level are assumed by the Ministerial Department of the Family and Promotion of Women, requiring a strong intersectoral and interdisciplinary link, involving and responsible actors such as:
National Assembly
Institutions of the judiciary
Government ministerial departments
Institutions of central and local state administration
Political parties
Non-Governmental Organisations
Civil Society Organisations
Academic and scientific community
Social Media
Communities and families
International partners",The Angolan NAP includes an allocated budget. The implementation of the national action plan is based on the allocation of resources through sectoral budgets. The general budget of the state should explain the percentage allocated to the different ministerial departments.,The NAP does not address disarmament issues. The NAP instead focuses on the Government’s attempt to restructure the way women view themselves as active participants in the country’s defense and security sectors.
Argentina,"Argentina adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2015 for the period 2015-2018 and the second NAP in 2022. Analysis on the 2022 NAP is forthcoming. The 2015 NAP was developed by the Ministry of External Relations and Culture in coordination with a number of ministries, including Ministries of Security; Justice and Human Rights; Interior and Transportation; Work, Labor and Social Security; Education; Health; Economy and Public Finances; and Defense. The NAP indicates civil society involvement in the NAP development process, but does not specify further details on which civil society actors were consulted. The NAP approaches the implementation of the WPS agenda both domestically and internationally. It aims to increase women’s participation in politics and include a gender perspective in all matters related to peace and security in the national, regional and international level. While the NAP has a monitoring and evaluation framework, it does not include an allocated budget. Argentina does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but the country was under a military dictatorship between 1976 and 1983, also labeled the “Dirty War.” In Argentina, women have a long history of peace activism, particularly during the military rule, when Argentine mothers and grandmothers, known as the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo , brought attention to the crimes of the military regime and demanded the safe return of all the people who were disappeared by the state security forces. In recent years, Argentine feminists have been calling for an end to femicide and sexual and gender-based violence in the country, including the country’s severe restrictions on sexual and reproductive health and rights. Most recently, feminist activists were pivotal in the legalization of abortion in Argentina in 2020. At the multilateral level, Argentina most recently served as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for the period 2013-2014.",1980,30,2014,3.143B,"NAP Development
In 2011, the former Ministry of External Relations and International Trade and Culture initiated a process of dialogue and rapprochement with CSO and women’s organizations to discuss their proposals for the NAP and to receive their feedback on the designing process of the NAP and the monitoring stage of its implementation.
In 2011, the Ministry of External Relations and International Trade and Culture convened all actors involved in the WPS agenda to participate in an inter-institutional exercise to build a joint vision on peace and security with a gender perspective as captured by the NAP. 
NAP Implementation
We currently do not have a list of civil society organizations that participated in the implementation process with the government. 
The following Ministries are listed as actors in the implementation of Argentina's NAP: Security; Justice and Human Rights; Interior and Transportation; Work, Labor and Social Security; Education; Health; Economy and Public Finances; Defense; and Exterior Relations and Culture. The National Council of Women is also included in the list.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
The NAP does not mention any civil society organization or civil society in general as an actor in the monitoring and evaluation process of the NAP's implementation. 
The following government institutions are responsible for monitoring and evaluating the NAP: the National Women Council and the Ministries of the Executive Power. 
Timeframe
The implementation period for the Argentinian National Action Plan is three years starting in 2015.",,"Argentina’s National Action Plan establishes four main goals:
Increase women’s presence both in peace and humanitarian missions as well as in decision-making positions.
Increase women’s political participation in peace and security matters, in peace negotiations, in conflict management and in the decision-making spaces for each of these spheres.
Include a gender perspective in all the peacebuilding activities and humanitarian aid missions, including DDR activities.
Protect women and girls’ human rights in conflict and post-conflict countries (including refugee camps and displacement), particularly from sexual and gender-based violence, as well as promoting a secure environment.","Each one of the four objectives, includes a list of various actions, as well as the government actors that will take the lead and be responsible for its implementation. The first fundamental goal, “Increase women’s presence both in peace and humanitarian missions as well as in their decision-making level”, includes seven actions assigned to the national sphere, i.e. the Argentinian State:
Strengthen the Council on Gender Policies in the Defense Ministry and the specific actors that promote and defend women’s human rights in the Ministry of Security as part of its role in promoting equality between men and women.
Identify the breakdown of deployed personnel in peace and humanitarian assistance missions according to sex and task developed, and include statistical data on the willingness of female candidates to deploy in peace missions.
Increase female personnel’s participation in the Army, in the essential staff, and in Military Observers and Liaison Officers roles in peace missions.
Continue to promote the dispersion of information regarding access to the current peace missions and women’s experiences in peace and humanitarian assistance missions in countries of conflict and post-conflict.
The White Helmet Commission should promote volunteer participation in peace missions, and would consider the inclusion of their personnel in various profiles that could assess the reconstruction processes in conflict and post-conflict countries as well as in situations of emergency and natural disasters.
Promote the egalitarian selection of humanitarian organization with female presence and/or gender perspectives for humanitarian assistance.","The Argentinian NAP includes a final page where the indicators for each objective is listed. For example, in order to fulfil the Objective number 2, “Increase women’s political participation in peace and security matters, in peace negotiations, in conflict management and in the decision-making spaces for each of these spheres”, this indicator is established:
The second year of the NAP implementation should have updated data on the number and percentage of women in the executive branch in the public administration.
Monitoring and Evaluation
The monitoring and evaluation indicators in this NAP aim to measure the advances in the implementation of the NAP in the three years period. These indicators have been created based on the indicators proposed by the Secretary General at the United Nations Security Council in response to UNSCR 1889 (2009).
Through the Department called Direccion de la Mujer, the Ministry of External Relations and Culture will convene the National Women Council and the Ministries of the Executive Power: Security; Justice and Human Rights; Interior and Transportation; Work, Labor and Social Security; Education; Health; Economy and Public Finances; and Defense. All of them will create and implement monitoring and evaluation mechanism with an institutional nature, which will guide their actions, enact the pertinent periodic revisions and announce advances in the implementation of the NAP.",,"Argentina’s National Action Plan does not include an allocated or estimated budget. No indicators or actions are included that formulate fundraising strategies, detail the level of funding required for each specific activity, or accountability mechanisms to ensure funding is raised and used in implementing the NAP. Nonetheless, the NAP states that each participating body is responsible for managing the human and financial resources needed to implement the NAP according to the actions established in it.","One of the main goals of the Argentinian NAP is to “include a gender perspective in all the peacebuilding activities and humanitarian aid missions, including DDR activities” and, one of the actions established to fulfill this goal is to offer capacity-building to the deployed personnel in peace missions on DDR from a gender perspective. This allows them to identify the specific needs of female ex combatants (women and girls), particularly, in social reintegration processes, women’s rights and protection from all kinds of violence, and in mechanisms to detect and address gender-based violence and human trafficking victims. Furthermore, in the peace and humanitarian assistance missions, the Punto Focal de Genero (Focal Gender Point) will participate in the execution of DDR operations when mandated by an appropriate body and will apply a gender perspective to these processes."
Armenia,"Armenia adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2019 for the period 2019-2021 and its most recent for the period 2022-2024. Analysis is forthcoming. The 2019-2021 NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but it does not indicate civil society inclusion in the development of the NAP. Armenia’s NAP focuses heavily on increasing women’s participation in and awareness of the protection of women’s rights within the defense system (military, police, and peacekeeping missions). The NAP also puts particular emphasis on creating comprehensive programs to address the needs of women and girls impacted by or displaced as a result of conflicts. The NAP includes components on the international implementation of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda, especially in light of the ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. However, the document specifically states that Armenia considers the NAP “as a national mechanism for the protection and promotion of women’s rights in public life” (p. 2). The NAP identifies 18 objectives that are grouped under the primary pillars of Resolution 1325: participation; protection; prevention; and relief and recovery. While each objective has corresponding actions, indicators, and responsible parties, there is no allocated funding. Armenia gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. The country has been in an ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan since 1988 as a result of the long-standing dispute over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. The conflict has resulted in thousands of casualties as well as refugees and internally displaced people (IDPs). Even though a ceasefire was put into effect in 1994, there has been ongoing tension between the two countries. The conflict erupted again most recently in 2022. The conflict has had distinct gendered impacts , affecting women’s lives in the public and private realm alike. Women’s organizations have been at the forefront to demand an end to hostilities and establish peace. Despite their on-the-ground efforts, women have been excluded from high-level diplomatic negotiations.",1993,98,,673M,"The analysis in these tabs corresponds to the 2019-2021 NAP.
NAP Development:
The NAP was developed by Armenia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
The NAP does not indicate civil society inclusion in the development of the NAP. 
WILPF does not have a country section in Armenia and therefore was not involved in the development process of Armenia’s NAP.
NAP Implementation:
The NAP lists non-governmental organizations as a “co-executor” of 10 out of the 18 objectives listed. Additionally, objectives #2 and #7 listed under participation directly outlines a goal to “promote cooperation between governmental bodies, women’s organizations, and women affected by conflicts” (p.2, implementation matrix) and “collaboration with national institutions, local self-governing bodies, non-governmental organizations” (p. 4, implementation matrix), respectively. Despite this emphasis on civil society on both objective, non-governmental organizations are not listed as a “co-executor” on the implementation matrix of either objective.  
The NAP indicates that an Interagency Commission, composed of representatives from 12 ministries and government organizations will be responsible for implementing the NAP. These government actors are: Prime Minister’s Office, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs, Ministry of Economic Development and Investments, Ministry of Emergency Situations, Ministry of Territorial Administration and Development, Police of the Republic of Armenia, National Institute of Education of the Ministry of Education and Science, State Migration Service of the Ministry of Territorial Administration and Development, and Armeanian Red Cross Society. 
NAP Monitoring & Evaluation:
The NAP indicates that a working group that consists of three ministries (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defense, and Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs) and three non-governmental organizations with “sufficient expertise and knowledge on issues related to Women, Peace and Security” (p. 10) will be established a year prior to the implementation of the NAP for monitoring and evaluation purposes. However, the NAP does not clearly indicate which NGOs will be a part of the working group.
The NAP indicates that a working group that consists of three ministries (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defense, and Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs) and three non-governmental organizations will be established a year prior to the implementation of the NAP for monitoring and evaluation purposes.",The implementation period of the NAP is two years (2019-2021).,"The NAP identifies 18 objectives, compiled under the four pillars of UNSCR 1325: participation, protection, prevention, and relief and recovery. On Armenia’s NAP, participation has seven objectives, protection has five objectives, prevention has four objectives, and relief and recovery has two objectives listed. For example, objective #2 listed under participation is: “Promote cooperation between governmental bodies, women’s organisations and women affected by conflicts, in the fields of conflict prevention, conflict resolution and peacebuilding.” (p. 2, implementation matrix).  ","The NAP has a detailed implementation matrix that breaks down each objective with corresponding measures, time limit, performance indicators, responsible executor, co-executor, and funding source. For example, objective #2 listed under participation identifies “organization of state-supported awareness raising campaigns and programmes for women’s organisations and women affected by conflicts on such issues as conflict prevention, confidence building measures, peacebuilding, as well as the challenges and risks related to them” as an activity (p. 2, implementation matrix). ","The NAP identifies several performance indicators for each objective, outlined on the implementation matrix. For example, objective #2 listed under participation identifies “ensuring more targeted activities within 1325 gender thematic group, including availability of seminars for women affected by conflicts” as a performance indicator (p. 2, implementation matrix).","The NAP indicates that a working group that consists of three ministries (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defense, and Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs) and three non-governmental organizations will be established a year prior to the implementation of the NAP for monitoring and evaluation purposes. The group will assess the work being conducted and offer needed recommendations on an annual basis. The NAP does not provide further specifics on monitoring and evaluation.","The NAP does not contain an allocated or estimated budget. Even though there is a “funding source” field for each objective, the field identifies “other sources not prohibited by law” for the funding source of each objective."," Even though Armenia has been in an ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh since 1988, the country’s NAP does not mention disarmament or demilitarization."
Australia,"Australia has adopted a second National Action Plan (NAP) for the period 2021-2031 . The development of Australia’s second National Action Plan comes at the behest of a changing global context, where new challenges including climate change and health pandemics contribute to fragility and conflict (p.6). The Australian Government developed their National Action Plan with recommendations from two independent reviews, national consultations conducted by government and civil society, and women, peace, and security research and evidence (p.11). It will be implemented by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Department of Defense, Department of Home Affairs, Australia’s Federal Police, and the Australian Civil-Military Centre. Australia adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2012, for the period 2012-2018. The NAP was developed by the Australian Government Office for Women, which was tasked with convening the Women, Peace and Security Inter-Departmental Working Group. The government undertook extensive civil society engagement leading up to and during the development of the NAP, including with WILPF Australia. The NAP approaches the implementation of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda mostly internationally. Australia does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but is a contributor to UN peacekeeping operations and NATO military missions and provides international humanitarian relief and development assistance. This includes peacekeeping missions in East Timor, regional assistance missions in the Solomon Islands, and humanitarian support and law enforcement to indigenous communities. Australia is a contributing donor to the Women’s Peace and Humanitarian Fund , a global partnership that works to empower women in conflict zones and humanitarian crises. Australia is also a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies , a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. In 2019, Australia was UN Women ’s ninth largest other resources and regular resources contributor with USD $8.8 million and USD $5.5 million, respectively. At the multilateral level, Australia most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2013-2014.",1983,44,2014,25.912B,"NAP Development 
The development of Australia’s second National Action Plan comes at the behest of a changing global context, where new challenges including violent extremism, climate, and health pandemics contribute to fragility and conflict (p.6). The Australian Government developed their National Action Plan with recommendations from two independent reviews, national consultations conducted by government and civil society, and women, peace, and security research and evidence (p.11). While civil society groups and organisations are not named explicitly as groups consulted in the development of the nation’s second NAP, the NAP does aim to strengthen partnerships with civil society and support their capacity building. In a commitment to work in partnership with civil society, the Australian government seeks to collaborate across “two key functions - advice and accountability” (p.55). 
NAP Implementation
The implementation of Australia’s National Action Plan is underpinned by the following four principles: a ‘do no harm’ approach, a human rights-based approach, gender mainstreaming, and recognising and responding to diverse experiences. The NAP declares women and girls participation to be at the centre of Australia’s efforts on implementation (p.8). The implementation plan will be delivered by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Department of Defense, Department of Home Affairs, Australia’s Federal Police, and the Australian Civil-Military Centre. These Departments will strengthen implementation by increasing women’s participation and leadership in the peace and security sector, building knowledge and capabilities, using evidence-based approaches, and strengthening their partnership with civil society (p. 10). Each implementing department and agency will develop and release its own implementation plan that will outline department and agency activities that contribute to National Action Plan outcomes. Implementation plans usually have a two-year duration (p.52). 
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation 
The NAP applies a results-based monitoring and evaluation framework that will support ongoing improvements to implementation to ensure progress towards outcomes, through progress reporting and independent review. Regular progress reporting will draw on qualitative evidence (including case studies) to demonstrate the impact of their initiative. Outcome data will be disaggregated at the country level where Australian implementation is focused (p. 58). Departments’ implementation plans will also identify actions that contribute to National Action Plan outcomes and medium term outcomes (p. 56). There will be regular progress reporting and quantitative indicators selected from available data sets for their ability to measure progress overtime. The Australian government recognises that new indicators and data sources may emerge as global gender data matures (p. 58). ","The Australia NAP covers a ten year period from 2021 to 2031. The Independent Interim review will be commissioned in July 2025 with the goal of completion in December 2025. The review will consider the effectiveness of actions in meeting the NAP’s medium-term outcomes, It will recommend ways to improve ongoing implementation and set targets for the end of this NAP (p.57). 
The Independent Final Review will assess the National Action Plan’s effectiveness over its lifetime. It will also consider changes relevant to the design of Australia’s third National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security. It will be commissioned by July 2030 with an aim to be completed by December 2030 (p.57). ","The Australia NAP is organised into four Key Outcomes designed to guide the nation’s international efforts in fragile and conflict-affected contexts. 
The first key outcome to support women’s meaningful participation and needs in peace processes will require increasing women’s participation in conflict prevention and in all peace processes (p. 10). 
The second key outcome to reduce sexual and gender based violence will require reducing harmful gender norms, increasing women and girl’s safety and security, and increasing access to justice (p.10). 
The third key outcome, supporting the resilient, crisis, and security, law and justice efforts to meet the needs of all women and girls, will require security, law, and justice responses, preventing and countering violent extremism, and humanitarian action, stabilisation and disaster management (p.10).
The final key outcome, demonstrating leadership and accountability for WPS, requires Australia’s demonstration of global leadership and accountability. These key outcomes are designed to reflect UNSCR 1325 and related resolutions (p.10). ","Each Outcome of the Australia NAP includes actions for practically achieving these goals followed by a case study demonstrating the validity of such actions. These key outcomes are categorized by thematic areas of the WPS agenda. 
For example, Key Outcome 1 calls for supporting women and girls’ meaningful participation and needs in conflict prevention and peace processes. This outcome is in alignment with the participation pillar of the WPS agenda. Meeting this commitment means (p.20): 
Connecting informal decision-making to formal decision-making in peace processes 
Redesigning peace negotiations to ensure women have a seat at the table 
Amplifying the efforts of civil society coalitions, women’s rights organisations and women’s human rights defenders, and 
Supporting women’s capacities to analyse, shape agendas, organize and exercise their voice and agency, and their political involvement - and recognising that sometimes they participate differently. 
Australia’s actions aim to (p. 21): 
ensure women and their representative organisations are included in political dialogues and development programming on conflict prevention 
ensure gender indicators are included in conflict early warning systems to better monitor and respond to women and girls’ experiences of insecurity 
support existing community mobilisation — including the efforts of civil society coalitions, women’s rights organisations and youth organisations and human rights defenders — to realise gender equality, remove existing barriers to decision-making structures, and address gendered barriers to social, economic and political rights 
conduct gender-sensitive conflict analysis that includes analysis of the drivers for conflict prevention and peace, and 
support existing efforts to challenge discriminatory gender norms, including about unpaid care, access to education, health and other services, and economic participation, that limit women and girls’ roles.  
Australia’s Actions Aim to (p.24): 
support women’s rights organisations to engage, participate and influence inclusive peace processes at all levels 
provide care services, and financial, transport and accommodation support to enable women to participate in peace and security processes as they occur • support capacity building to ensure men and women, including in negotiation and mediation teams, can design gender equality provisions 
support capacity building to ensure men and women can implement the gender equality provisions of peace agreements • influence government agencies involved in the peace process to incorporate women’s issues and provide access for women in negotiations or discussions 
use Australia’s diplomatic leadership to advocate, including for women and girls’ participation in peace processes, reconciliation and stabilisation efforts, and • ensure women and girls can access education and economic opportunities.","The Australia NAP lists measures associated with each key outcome in its monitoring and evaluation from work and identifies the organization collecting that data. 
Example taken from Key Outcome 3: Supporting resilience, crisis response, and security, law and justice sector efforts to meet the needs and rights of all women and girls (p.61): 
Outcome Indicators (p. 61) 
Number and percentage of countries that have laws and regulations that restrict women’s ability to participate in society and the economy relative to men; data collected by UN Women, World Bank, OECD, ILO

","Progress reporting will track the Australian Government’s contributions to the Women, Peace and Security Agenda and will be delivered regularly over the course of the National Action Plan (p.57). Progress reports will capture departments’ implementation actions and the monitoring and evaluation framework will form the basis of progress resorting. 
Two independent reviews will be commissioned over the course of the National Action Plan. Recommendations from the independent reviews will be considered by the Australian Government and inform ongoing implementation.

Austria,"Austria adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2012, but the NAP does not identify a specific period of implementation. The NAP was developed by an inter-ministerial group, which consisted of the Federal Ministries of European and International Affairs; Interior; Justice; Defence; Sports; along with the Federal Chancellery and the Austrian Development Agency. The NAP indicates civil society involvement in the NAP development, implementation, and monitoring process. Austria’s NAP approaches the implementation of the WPS Agenda both domestically and internationally, and outlines three main objectives towards the implementation of UNSCR 1325. These include increasing the representation of women in international peace operations; strengthening the participation of women in peace initiatives and high-level decision-making spaces; and preventing gender-based violence and protecting the rights of women in humanitarian settings. The NAP outlines a monitoring and evaluation framework that consists of annual reviews and comprehensive reporting requirements. Austria’s NAP does not include an allocated budget, but indicates that the activities identified in the NAP “will be ensured by the responsible ministries within the funds available in their respective budgets.” Austria’s second NAP is preceded by one other NAP, adopted in 2007, without a specific period of implementation. The NAP was developed through the cooperation of several ministries following consultations with civil society members. Austria’s first and second NAPs are similar in length and level of detail, approaching the implementation of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda in a mostly international way. As such, the NAPs identify increasing women’s representation in peacekeeping operations; lobbying for the implementation of Resolution 1325 at the multilateral level; and supporting gender-based reforms in conflict-affected countries among some of its objectives. The second NAP does not provide an overview of the findings from the implementation of the first NAP, nor does it have a lessons learned section. The first NAP identifies working with civil society on conflict prevention and peacebuilding as a priority area for international cooperation. While civil society still has a role in the second NAP, its incorporation appears to focus more on “engagement” and capacity building instead of being framed as a cooperation. Austria reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country provided the following updates: Within the scope of the NAP, measures are taken to promote the participation of women in peace processes, to strengthen preventive measures against violence against women, to increase the proportion of women participating in peacekeeping operations and to increase the proportion of women in leadership positions in international organisations like the UN or the EU. (p. 18) A working group led by the Federal Ministry for Europe, Integration and Foreign Affairs, reviews the implementation of the NAP once a year. (pp. 61-62) The most recent, ninth implementation report offers an overview of the level of implementation of the revised NAP and the measures taken to support women in conflict and post-conflict situations in 2017. (pp. 61-62) The Austrian Development Agency passed a gender guideline which also aims to implement the NAP 1325. In addition to that, the Austrian Development Agency supports a number of initiatives in the field women, peace, security. (pp. 61-62) Austria does not have a history of recent armed conflict, but contributes to overseas military and peacekeeping operations. Austria is also a contributor to humanitarian aid, including being a contributing donor to the Women’s Peace and Humanitarian Fund , a global partnership that works to empower women in conflict zones and humanitarian crises. At the multilateral level, Austria most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2009-2010 and is currently a candidate for a non-permanent member position for the period 2027-2028.",1982,,2014,4.8B,"NAP Development
Ten civil society organizations and three specific organizations (CARE Austria, University of Vienna – Department of International Relations, and Ludwig Boltzmann Institute of Human Rights) were consulted prior to the development of the first NAP, and although it was mandated in the NAP, Civil Society was not provided opportunity to have input into the review that informed the current revised NAP.
WILPF does not have a country section in Austria and therefore was not involved in the development process of Austria’s NAP.
The development of the NAP was led by the Austrian Inter-ministerial group, that includes the participation of the FCH, the Federal Chancellery, Directariate General II, FMEIA Federal Ministry of European and International Affairs , FMoI Federal Ministry of the Interior, FMoJ Federal Ministry of Justice, FMoDS Federal Ministry of Defense and Sports, and ADA Austrian Development Agency.
NAP Implementation
Civil society has an ongoing specified role in providing input on specific cases and to annual reporting. The first and revised NAP articulate that the Inter-ministerial Working Group must hold at least one meeting with Civil Society each year. However Civil Society implementation reviews have noted that although the Inter-ministerial Working Group has been accessible to Civil Society on an ad hoc basis, the requirement to schedule formal meetings had not been met. Further, although required in the NAP, implementation reviews for the first NAP were conducted without Civil Society consultation.
The Inter-ministerial working group of Austria will continue to operate as the primary Austrian Government mechanism responsible for Austria’s implementation of the UNSCR 1325 and UNSCR 1820. In addition, the UN Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women which became operational as of 1 January 2011, has been playing a role in Austria’s process and protocol regarding UNSCR 1325.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
Civil Society also has a role outside the limited formal mechanisms specified in the NAP, particularly through oversight, promoting UNSCR 1325, education and training, as well as cooperation and support with international organizations and women at the grass roots level. Civil Society in Austria has lacked coordination, and in recognizing this in 2008, CARE Austria initiated the informal Group of Friends of UN SCR 1325, which has met on a semi-regular basis with government ministries and civil society groups. 
While an annual meeting takes place, Austria pays close attention to the application of the UN Indicators for monitoring the implementation of UNSCR 1325. Furthermore, while the meeting is held annually, additional meetings and conferences take place, lastly appropriate measures are taken to include civil society, and raise awareness.","The Austrian NAP does not specify timeframes set for Actions. However, many activities are identified as an “ongoing” and to be reviewed in an annual report. (seen throughout Austria’s NAP).","The Revised Austrian National Action Plan contains the same three objectives:
Strategic Objective 1: Increase the representation of women as well as enhanced consideration of the objectives defined in Resolution 1325 in training activities for international peace operations.
Strategic Objective 2: Strengthen the participation of women in peace promoting and conflict resolving activities, especially by promoting local peace initiatives by women and increasing the share of women in decision-making positions in international and European organization.
Strategic Objective 3: Prevent gender-specific violence and protecting the needs of women and girls within the scope of peace missions, humanitarian operations and in camps for refugees and internally displaced persons.","The Austrian National Action Plan is organized by national, international/regional and bilateral, and development cooperation activities, which can be found in detail in the NAP.
Strategic Objective 2 of the Austrian NAP includes a series of actions for practically achieving these goals.
Strategic Objective 2: Participation, “Promoting political participation of women. Strengthening the representation of women through capacity-building” contains the following actions:
Strategies and measures taken to increase the share of women in the overall number of Austrian participants in the UN and EU peace operations and OSCE missions.
Deployment of gender experts, gender advisors, junior officer professionals and other experts.
Balanced nominations of male and female Austrians to EU and OSCE election monitoring missions.
Increased nominations of female Austrians to leadership positions in EU, UN and all OSCE dimensions.","The Austrian NAP lists measures associated with each strategic objective in its monitoring and evaluation framework. These range from measurable and specific to general and are principally qualitative in nature.
For example, in Strategic Objective 3: ""Provision of technical support to security sector reform and monitoring activities"": 
Support for measures aimed at strengthening protection, security and human rights, and the total amount of financial support provided.","Inter-ministerial Working Group, which is led by the Federal Ministry for European and International Affairs and comprised of representatives of all relevant ministries and the Austrian Development Agency.
The working group is required to provide annual progress reports to the Austrian Council of Ministers, which is then forwarded to Parliament. Civil society is required to have input in the review process, facilitated primarily through annual joint meetings, and the provision of ad hoc civil society representation to the working group. Civil Society input must be sought in advance of preparing annual reports. As noted, this did not occur during the life of the first NAP.
Coordination, Monitoring and Reporting is a priority within the “Activities in Austria” strategic area of the NAP. As such, specific activities, indicators, timelines and responsible actors are articulated.
Annual reports must be forwarded to the Parliament and made publicly available through departmental websites.
A comprehensive review of the NAP, in cooperation with Civil Society, is scheduled for 2016.","The Austrian NAP does not include an allocated or estimated budget, and instead states that “Financing of the activities resulting from the implementation of the Action Plan will be ensured by the responsible ministries within the funds available in their respective budgets.”
The initial NAP and its revision did not include indicators or actions to formulate strategies for sourcing increased funding, level of funding required for specific activities, or accountability mechanisms to ensure funding is raised and used in implementing the NAP. ",Austria's 2012 revised NAP does not specifically mention disarmament.

Bangladesh,"Bangladesh adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) for the period 2019-2022. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs through a participatory approach that included civil society organizations as well as divisional and district-level consultations with grassroots women’s organizations. Bangladesh’s NAP builds on the country’s prior gender legislation and action plans, including those on preventing violence against women and children; human trafficking; development; and disaster policy. In line with this background, the NAP provides an overview of Bangladesh’s WPS-related legal and political actions as well as a detailed discussion of women’s experiences and needs related to the Women, Peace, and Security Agenda, addressed extensively as part of the NAP development process. The NAP identifies nine overall objectives grouped under three thematic clusters that focus on prevention; participation; and protection, relief, and recovery. The NAP indicates that the remnants of Bangladesh’s Liberation War and the wartime sexual violence endured by women had an impact on the content of the action plan, especially with regards to the rehabilitation of women victims. Additionally, one of the key objectives of the NAP highlights root cause analysis and gender-responsive conflict monitoring as key to conflict prevention. While the NAP has a detailed implementation matrix, it does not include an allocated budget. Bangladesh gained independence in 1971 following the Indo-Pakistani War, also known as the Bangladesh Liberation War. The conflict resulted in thousands of casualties, with sexual violence used as a weapon of war through the mass rape of Bangladeshi women. In 2010, Bangladesh’s Awami League (AL) government established the International Crimes Tribunal (ICT), a domestic court charged with investigating the genocide and war crimes that occurred during the 1971 war. However, the court is yet to fully address wartime sexual and gender-based violence. More recently, in 1997, Bangladesh signed the Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord in order to end the long-lasting ethnic conflict between the Bangladeshi government and its indigenous populations. Since 2017, Bangladesh has also been grappling with the spillover effects of Myanmar’s ethnic cleansing campaign against the Rohingya people, and currently hosts over 700,000 Rohingya refugees, most of whom are women and girls. Women’s rights activists in Bangladesh have been working to reduce violence against women, including acid attacks , which is among the primary forms of gender-based violence in the country. At the multilateral level, Bangladesh most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2000-2001, during which it played a key role in the adoption of Resolution 1325, the landmark resolution of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda.",1984,50,,4.358B,"NAP Development
The NAP was developed through a participatory approach that incorporated civil society organizations into the NAP’s development through multiple consultations, a national seminar, and a validation workshop conducted prior to the NAP’s approval. 
WILPF does not have a country section in Bangladesh and therefore was not involved in the development process of its NAP.
The NAP was developed through a participatory approach that included governmental and non-governmental organizations. The meetings of the NAP Coordination Group were overseen by Bangladesh’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
NAP Implementation
An inter-ministerial Coordination Group, which includes two civil society representatives, will be responsible for implementing and monitoring the NAP. Additionally, the NAP indicates that Bangladesh’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs “will coordinate to mobilize civil society organizations working in relevant programmatic sectors to support the implementing agencies, to deliver results and create greater impact” (p. 12). 
An inter-ministerial Coordination Group will be responsible for implementing and monitoring the NAP. Additionally, individual ministries are tasked with implementing specific activities identified in the action plan.   
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
An inter-ministerial Coordination Group, which includes two civil society representatives, will be responsible for implementing and monitoring the NAP. Additionally, the NAP indicates that a Consultative Platform of civil society organizations will be established to enable civil society inclusion in the monitoring, reporting, and evaluation process of the action plan.
An inter-ministerial Coordination Group will be responsible for implementing and monitoring the NAP. Bangladesh’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs will oversee the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation team.   ",The implementation period of the NAP is three years (2019-2022).,"The NAP identifies three pillars through which to implement the action plan: 1) prevention, 2) participation, and 3) protection, relief, and recovery. The overall objectives of these pillars are as follows:
Prevention: To engage more communities and institutions in initiatives to promote social cohesion and prevent conflict, violent extremism, and gender discrimination. 
Participation: To increase women’s meaningful participation in maintaining peace and security, including peacebuilding and conflict resolution processes, peacekeeping missions, disaster management and response, humanitarian assistance, and the prevention of violent extremism. 
Protection, relief, and recovery: To protect women’s safety and well-being and to ensure that their needs, priorities and rights are addressed in the emergency situations of natural disasters and humanitarian crises.","The NAP’s three main pillars each have an overall objective, which are then broken down into sub-objectives (referred to as “outputs”). While the first and second pillars (prevention and participation) each have one output, the third pillar (protection, relief, and recovery) has three outputs. For example, the pillar on “prevention,” lists “key government institutions have increased their awareness and knowledge of the root causes of conflict and violent extremism and how to address them, including an understanding of the role women play in preventing conflict and violent extremism” as an output (p. 14). This output is then broken down into specific activities, one of which is as follows: “Commission research on the root causes of conflict and violent extremism in Bangladesh and their effect on women, including a mapping of existing research on gender and violent extremism and the roles women play in preventing violent extremism” (p. 14). ","The NAP identifies several indicators for each objective, outlined in the implementation matrix. For example, the outcome for the overall objective of the prevention pillar lists “Number of research initiatives conducted on the root causes of conflict and violent extremism, the role of women, and their effect on women” as an indicator.","The annual progress of the NAP’s implementation will be jointly monitored by the Coordination Group and the Consultative Platform through a multi-tier monitoring plan. The Coordination Group will develop a “standard, results-based reporting template” (p. 13) to monitor the NAP. Based on the indicators identified in the monitoring framework, sex and age-disaggregated data will be collected. Each ministry and department or division represented on the Coordination Group will appoint a contact person to lead internal monitoring and reporting. Additionally, Bangladesh’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs will oversee the establishment of a monitoring and evaluation team. Relevant ministries and departments or divisions will submit annual progress reports to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The monitoring and evaluation team will then consolidate these reports and present them to the Coordination Group and the Consultative Platform for review and feedback. Finally, a thorough review of the overall NAP implementation will be conducted at the end of three years, and the NAP may be revised for a further period upon consultations with stakeholders.","The NAP indicates that the action plan “will be funded primarily by the state budgeting mechanism” and that each responsible ministry will incorporate WPS actions into their individual budget, which is already gender-responsive. Additionally, the NAP states that “additional resources from prospective international and multinational development partners will be sought” (p. 12). However, the NAP does not include an overall allocated or estimated budget.",The NAP does not address disarmament or demilitarization.
Belgium,"Belgium adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2017 for the period 2017-2021. The drafting of the NAP was coordinated by the Institute for the Equality of Women and Men and the FPS Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation, in collaboration with the Ministry of Defense, the FPS Interior and the SPF Justice as well as consultations with civil society. The NAP identifies several overarching objectives: to promote the implementation of an international regulatory framework; to integrate gender perspectives in the actions taken by Belgium in conflicts, peace, and security; to fight against all forms of violence against women and girls, and specifically sexual violence; to encourage women to participate in processes regarding conflict, peace, and security; and to ensure the oversight and monitoring of the implementation of the WPS Agenda and of the NAP. Each objective has corresponding goals, actions, indicators, and responsible parties, but does not include an allocated budget. Belgium’s third NAP is preceded by two other NAPs adopted in 2008 and 2013 and implemented for the period 2008-2012 and 2013-2016, respectively. Both the second and third NAPs have standalone sections devoted to lessons learned from the implementation of the previous NAPs. Even though all three NAPs have an international focus in the implementation of the WPS agenda, the second and third NAPs do emphasize the importance of focusing on gender equality and promoting gender mainstreaming across national institutions in Belgium. Different from the first two NAPs, the third NAP also addresses disarmament and arms control, including embracing a “gender-based approach” with regards to decisions and actions within arms treaties and conventions. Belgium does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but is a key contributor to UN peacekeeping missions and NATO operations. Furthermore, Belgium continues to export arms to the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, which perpetuates and exacerbates the gendered impact of arms transfers. Belgium is a major contributor to development aid and humanitarian assistance, including being a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies , a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. In 2019 , the Belgian parliament adopted a law to establish a human rights institution at the federal level. Despite this development, civil society activists have raised concerns about the overall violation of migrants’ rights in the country.

NAP Implementation
This NAP does not fully recognise the hard work of civil society. The NAP does state that consultations with external actors, including civil society and local women's organizations, is necessary in order to better identify their needs and priorities and to find greater support for peace initiatives proposed by women. While the importance of consultations is mentioned, there is only one goal (Objective 6, Goal 35) that demonstrates Belgium’s want to act in this regard: “Inform and involve civil society. Ensure the exchange of information, gender expertise available in Belgium and consultations with civil society, at least in the middle and at the end of the period covered by the NAP”. Indicators include: “Organization of two reporting and consultation events. Number of civil society organizations involved”.
At the federal level, there is a gender mainstreaming law that requires all administrations to integrate gender within its politics, measures, budget preparations and actions. Every intervention must integrate gender.
The framework for implementation of the NAP comprises of several parts. The NAP contains six objectives, each of which contains several goals, action steps and indicators. Each department mentioned is responsible for specific goals, action steps and indicators. These include: Affaires Étrangères (Foreign Affairs), Développement (Development), Défense (Defense), Intérieur (Interior), Justice (Justice), Égalité (Equality), Intérieur-OE (Interior OE), Intérieur-CGRA/OE (Interior CGRA/OE), Intérieur-Fedasil (Interior-Fedasil) and Intérieur-POLFED (Interior-POLFED). For example, Objective 3, “Fight against all forms of violence against women and girls, and more specifically sexual violence”, contains the goal “Impose on Belgian peacekeeping forces zero tolerance on violence against women”. The action is “Prosecute perpetrators of sexual violence in the defense department”, and the indicator is “Ratio of the number of complaints to the number of prosecutions. Ratio of the number of prosecutions to the number of convictions”. The department in charge of achieving all of this is the Defense Department.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
Civil society does not have an important role in the monitoring and evaluation process.
There is an annual report submitted to the Parliament, which gathers information about the actions carried out during the previous year, so the Parliament can stay informed of the progress achieved and to ensure regular monitoring of the NAP.",The implementation period for the National Plan of Action of Belgium is five years (2017-2021).,"By 2021, the commitments of Belgium towards Women, Peace and Security are to be realised through the following objectives:
Objective 1: Promote the implementation of the international normative framework;
Objective 2: Integrate a gender dimension into Belgian actions in conflict, peace and security;
Objective 3: Fight against all forms of violence against women and girls, and more specifically sexual violence;
Objective 4: Promote women's participation in processes concerning conflict, peace and security;
Objective 5: Support the Women, Peace and Security Agenda;
Objective 6: Assure that the Women, Peace and Security Agenda and the NAP are followed and monitored.","Each objective has different goals, actions, indicators and departments assigned to achieve these. For example, Objective 1 “Promote the implementation of the international normative framework” includes the following:
Goal 1.: Ensure that treaties and conventions concerning the improvement of the situation and the empowerment of women are taken into account:
Action 1a: Apply in Belgium the international conventions that ensure the rights of women;
Action 1b: Continue to intervene actively in the of the United Nations (General Assembly, CSW, Council human rights, etc.) to put forward women's rights, particularly in countries in (post-) conflict;
Action 1c: Call all countries systematically to subscribe and respect the conventions that ensure the rights of women.
Goal 2: Promote the position of women, particularly in countries in situations of fragility:
Action 2a: Give priority and financial support to gender equality and empowerment of women, especially in fragile countries;
Action 2b: Approach all political advocacy, international declarations and interventions in the field on the basis of a strategic and coherent framework to strengthen women's empowerment;
Action 2c: Offer expertise and participate in the exchange of good practices;
Action 2d: Support UN Women and its advocacy role in relation to the equality of women and men and women's empowerment;
Action 2e: Continue to support the mandate of the UN on laws and practices discriminatory against women;
Action 2f: Support the OSCE Special Representative Action Plan for the Promotion of Gender Equality;
Action 2g: Act in the context of political advocacy and international declarations;
Goal 3: Ensuring respect for the health and sexual and reproductive rights of women:
Action 3a: Integrate respect for sexual health and rights, and reproductive health, into humanitarian aid programs and Reconstruction programs;
Action 3b: Call on all countries to ensure respect for the health and sexual and reproductive rights of women and defend these rights at the international level;
Action 3c: Advocate for the mention of health and sexual and reproductive rights in international agreements.
Goal 4: Improve the legal framework and rules of procedure so that women can have better access to justice (national/international):
Action 4a: Financially support the funds of the International Criminal Court in favor of victims;
Action 4b: Support initiatives that facilitate women and girls’ access to
justice, to ensure protection of their rights (land/inheritance/discrimination etc.);
Action 4c: Call on all countries to ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court;
Action 4d: Call on all countries to apply the broadest definition of sexual violence.","To achieve each objective, the NAP has different indicators assigned. For example, Objective 1 (“Promote the implementation of the international normative framework”), Goal 1 (“Ensure that treaties and conventions concerning the improvement of the situation and the empowerment of women are taken into account”), includes the following indicators:
Indicator 1a: Periodic reporting under CEDAW. Tracking reporting issues and relevant questionnaires. Follow-up to the Istanbul Convention;
Indicator 1b: UN Actions (CSW, Council of human rights, etc.);
Indicator 1c: Interventions made. Calls in the context of policies and agreements concluded.","The revised Belgian NAP includes the names of departments responsible for the implementation of the lines of action. While the indicators may also count as monitoring and evaluation mechanisms, there is no specific monitoring and evaluation framework offered in the NAP.
In 2010, Civil Society was charged with evaluating the NAP in cooperation with the government. In the new version, evaluation bodies are not clearly defined.","There is no total cost of the NAP implementation mentioned in this NAP. The implementation of the NAP mentions various government sectors in terms of funding Women, Peace and Security. The NAP calls for using all financial means set aside for international cooperation should be used in a way that supports women’s empowerment.
The NAP does not elaborate on plans, strategies or mechanisms to ensure activities are funded within departmental budgets. However, the Belgium NAP notes that they have existing gender-sensitive budget requirements under its federal legislation. 
No indicators or actions are included that formulate strategies for sourcing increased funding, detail what level of funding is required for which specific activities, or what accountability mechanisms will ensure funding is raised and used in implementing the NAP.","The NAP includes specific actions on arms control and disarmament, including:
Ensure compliance at all times with article 7.4 within the framework of the implementation of the Treaty on the Arms Trade (ban on exports in cases of ‘Gender-Based violence/violence Against Women and children’).
Support the full and meaningful participation of women in the fight against the illegal trafficking and misuse of small arms and low caliber weapons.
Promoting the gender-based approach, and more specifically, the SPF resolutions in the joint Positions and decisions of the European Council regarding disarmament and the outreach by various treaties and conventions relating to disarmament and arms control, and the Interventions carried out. (CABT, TCA, CIAC, UNPoA ), …)"
Bosnia And Herzegovina,"Bosnia-Herzegovina adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2018, for the period 2018-2022. The NAP was developed by the country’s Agency for Gender Equality and the Ministry for Human Rights and Refugees, based on the results of and recommendations from the evaluation of the second action plan. Similar to the country’s previous NAP, Bosnia-Herzegovina’s third action plan contextualizes the WPS agenda by providing a detailed overview of the country’s domestic legal framework and critically examines the legislative and policy developments to advance women’s full participation in public and political life. The NAP also offers a detailed gender equality analysis of women’s participation in high-level decision-making positions such as in the security forces and peacekeeping missions. Additionally, the NAP has a section devoted to analyzing human security through the perspective of gender equality, which includes sections on human trafficking, victims of sexual violence and other wartime atrocities, and landmines as well as touching upon natural disasters, migration, violent exremism, and small arms and light weapons. While the NAP includes a detailed implementation matrix, it does not have an allocated budget. Bosnia-Herzegovina’s third NAP is preceded by two other NAPs, adopted in 2010 and 2014 and implemented for the period 2010-2013 and 2014-2017, respectively. All three of Bosnia-Herzegovina’s NAP are equally detailed, including dedicated sections that contextualize the WPS agenda within the country’s domestic gender equality frameworks. Additionally, both the second and third NAPs include a standalone section that discusses “lessons learned” from the implementation of the previous action plans.  The overall goals of the NAPs have also remained consistently similar, focusing on participation, prevention, and protection, with the exception of the third NAP, which has added the prevention of the misuse of small arms and light weapons as an action item amongst the overarching objectives. Bosnia-Herzegovina gained independence from former Yugoslavia in 1992. The country went through a violent armed conflict between 1992 and 1995, where ethnic cleansing and sexual violence were used as weapons of war. The conflict resulted in thousands of casualties and missing people and millions of refugees, and came to an end through the Dayton Peace Agreement . Even though women survived severe wartime atrocities and yet were still at the forefront of peacebuilding initiatives, they were excluded from high-level diplomatic negotiations. Increased rates of domestic violence and human trafficking are remnants of the war with which the country is still grappling. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was established in 1993 to prosecute crimes committed during the Yugoslav Wars. ICTY investigated and indicted perpetrators of wartime sexual violence in Bosnia-Herzegovina, recognizing for the first time rape as a war crime as well as a crime against humanity. In July 2018, Bosnia-Herzegovina signed the Joint Declaration on Missing Persons and Joint Declaration on War Crimes in the Framework of the Berlin Process at the Western Balkans Summit Leaders Meeting. Despite being a signatory to the declaration, the Bosnian government has not taken an official position to support RECOM , a regional truth commission to investigate war crimes and human rights violations committed between 1991 and 2001 in former Yugoslavia. At the multilateral level, Bosnia-Herzegovina most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2010-2011.",1993,69,2014,162M,"NAP Development
The NAP indicates that non-governmental organizations represented on the coordination board (which is responsible for monitoring the NAP’s implementation) were consulted in the development of the NAP. 
WILPF does not have a country section in Bosnia-Herzegovina and therefore was not involved in the development process of its NAP.
The NAP was developed by Bosnia-Herzegovina’s Agency for Gender Equality and the Ministry for Human Rights and Refugees.  
NAP Implementation
Non-governmental organizations are listed as partners in implementing select objectives. However, the NAP does not specify how or which organizations will play a role in the NAP’s implementation. 
Several ministries, such as the Ministry of Defense and Ministry of Justice, among others, are tasked with implementing various objectives of the NAP.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
The NAP will be monitored by a coordination board, which consists of members from institutions within the security sector and one member representing non-governmental organizations.",The implementation period of the NAP is four years (2018-2022).,"The NAP identifies three strategic objectives:
Increased participation of women in military forces, police and peacekeeping missions, including participation in decision-making positions;
Increased level of human security from gender equality perspective;
Improved conditions and access to the implementation of AP UNSCR 1325.","The NAP includes a detailed implementation matrix that breaks down each strategic objective with corresponding medium-term objectives, anticipated outcomes, activities, holders (i.e., parties responsible for implementation), time-limit, and source of financing. For example, strategic objective #1 identifies, “Key policies, legislation and other regulations enable the increased participation of women in military forces, police and peacekeeping missions, including participation in decision-making positions” as a mid-term objective. One of the corresponding activities for this objective is identified as “Analysing and identifying obstacles (visible and hidden) for larger participation and advancement of women in the system of defence and security, including decision-making positions (investigate the reasons which directly affect employment/recruiting of women and career management).”","Similar to the country’s second NAP, Bosnia-Herzegovina’s third NAP will follow the qualitative and quantitative indicators identified in the monitoring and evaluation plan, which will be created after the adoption of the NAP.
 ","The NAP does not include a monitoring and evaluation plan. However, a separate monitoring and evaluation plan will be made available after the adoption of the NAP to streamline the monitoring process. Additionally, the NAP’s implementation will be monitored by a coordination board, which consists of members from institutions within the security sector and one member representing non-governmental organizations.","Even though the NAP’s implementation matrix includes a column for “source of funding” for each activity, neither the activities nor the NAP has an allocated or estimated budget.","The NAP does not directly address disarmament, but does touch upon related topics. Specifically, in line with the action plan’s strategic goal of achieving “increased levels of human security from the perspective of gender equality,” the NAP touches upon the link between illegal posession of small arms and light weapons and violence against women and domestic violence. Additionally, the NAP addresses the need to reduce the risk of landmines and explosive remnants of war in a gender-responsive way. Finally, the NAP refers to the Beijing Declaration’s emphasis on the need to “decrease military expenditure” (p. 5) while contextualizing the NAP in an international legal framework. However, the NAP does not specify how Bosnia-Herzegovina will address military expenditure or disarmament overall."
Brazil,"Brazil adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2017, for the period 2017-2019, and was subsequently renewed for four years . It adopted its second NAP in 2023. The 2017 NAP was developed by an interministerial working group, which consisted of the Ministries Foreign Affairs; Defense; Justice; Public Security; and Human Rights, with a participatory approach that included consultations with civil society organizations. The NAP identifies four major goals that aim to increase the participation of women in international peace and security; prevent gender-based violence and promote the human rights of all women and girls before, during, and after conflict; strengthen humanitarian actions through a gender-sensitive framework; and expand awareness of the WPS agenda within Brazil. While each objective has corresponding actions, the NAP does not include an allocated budget. Brazil reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country provided the following updates: Considering that the National Plan of Action on Women, Peace and Security will soon reach its term, the review process has already begun. As in the preparation of the text of the NPA, the review process is led by the Inter‐ministerial Working Group, coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and encompassing the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Justice and Public Safety, Ministry of Women, Family and Human Rights, UN‐Women and Instituto Igarapé as a representative of civil society. The review process began in 1 November 2018, in Brasília, with a seminar entitled “National Plan of Action on Women, Peace and Security: implementation and review”. This event, organized in partnership with the Alexandre de Gusmão Foundation (FUNAG), included representatives from governmental agencies, military officials, foreign governments and civil society. The debates provided conclusions and suggestions that inform the efforts to review the NPA. Among those, the importance of effective and continuous monitoring mechanisms on national plans was particularly highlighted. There has also been opinions in support of broadening the scope of participation and capacity training of non‐military women (diplomats, police officers and civilians) in peacekeeping operations, special political missions, negotiations on peace and security issues and mediation. Brazil does not have a history of recent armed conflict, but went through a period of military dictatorship from 1964 to 1985. To this date, impunity persists for human rights violations by military officers, with a 1979 amnesty law, which was upheld in 2010 by the country’s supreme court, protecting perpetrators. Brazil experiences deep socioeconomic inequalities, with protests erupting over public funds spent for the World Cup in 2014 as well as the mistreatment of marginalized residents and laborers. Brazil has a vibrant feminist movement , and women across the country are working to protect and promote women’s human rights, including through the participation of women’s civil society organizations in institutions such as the National Council on Women’s Rights . In 2019, Brazil was among the top 15 countries with the highest military expenditure as well as being among the top 25 arms exporters in the world. At the multilateral level, Brazil most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2010-2011.",1994,92,2014,27B,"The analysis in these tabs corresponds to the 2017 NAP.
NAP Development
Civil society members Instituto Igarapé supported the development of Brazil’s NAP and contributed the development of support for the NAP by organising consultations with government institutions, civil society organisations and experts from academia.
WILPF does not have a country section in Brazil and therefore was not involved in the development process of Brazil’s NAP.
Prior the official launch of the NAP, Brazil has undertook several attempts to broaden women’s participation  in decision-making, security and peacekeeping. These initiatives include the Multi-Year Plan (2012-2015) and the National Plan of policies for Women.
Since August 2015, the preparation of the Plan was carried out by the Working Group, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, representatives of the Ministry of Defense including the three Armed Forces, and the Ministries of Justice and Public Security and Human Rights and the Ministry of Justice and Citizenship, with participation of Instituto Igarapé and Pandiá Calógeras.
NAP Implementation
Civil society will support the NAP’s implementation, educate and expand their cooperation with the ministries that implement the NAP.
The Brazilian NAP will be implemented by government officials, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Defense and the Brazilian Government.  
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
Civil society does not have an important role in monitoring and evaluation. According to the NAP, civil society and other actors will be used to spread the “knowledge and engagement about the National Action Plan in Brazil.”
The actors for monitoring and evaluating are the Ministries of Defense, Foreign Relations, Justice and Public Security, and Human Rights. Their roles are to monitor mechanisms of the NAP’s implementation by creating reports on the measures taken to meet the objectives and activities, the progress made, and the challenges identified.",The implementation period for the Brazilian National Plan of Action is two years starting in March 2017. The NAP was later renewed for four subsequent years.,"Brazil’s National Action Plan is organised by four Pillars as follows:
Pillar 1: To increase the effective participation of Brazilian women in international peace and security activities, including in leadership positions and promote the effective participation of local women;
Pillar 2: To expand and improve Brazil’s contribution to tackle gender-based violence and to protect the human rights of all women and girls in conflict situations, pre and post-conflict;
Pillar 3: To strengthen the gender perspective in Brazil's role in  the development and execution of consolidation of peace and humanitarian activities of cooperation;
Pillar 4: To expand awareness of the WPS Agenda in Brazilian society.","Each pillar has different actions assigned. For example, Pillar 1 “to increase the effective participation of Brazilian women in international peace and security activities, including in leadership positions and promote the effective participation of local women” includes the following actions:
Increase the sense of security of the local population and extends the range of peace operations skills;
Facilitate the inclusion of ex-combatant women during the process of demobilisation and reintegration into society;
Expand information of collection networks;
Contribute to interviews with survivors of gender-based violence;
Promote a better interaction with women in local societies and serve as a model for local women;
Have women contribute as instructors at military academies.",The NAP does not identify any indicators towards the implementation of its actions/activities.,"The reporting and review processes are follow-up tasks of NAP compliance from Gender Commissions and/or specific committees’ contributions. At the end of 2018, the Working Group will reconvene in order to assess the Plan’s implementation and make any necessary adjustments. Any desire to make a new NAP during the implementation period will be discussed by the Working Group, which will present its recommendations to the institutions and bodies involved.","Brazil does not include an allocated or estimated budget. No actions are included that formulate strategies for sourcing increased funding, detail what level of funding is required for which specific activities, or what accountability mechanisms will ensure funding is raised and used in implementing the NAP.","The National Action Plan does not address disarmament issues or connect the proliferation of weapons with women’s insecurity. Instead, Brazilian NAP showcases the intention of the Government to re-frame women’s role in society so that women see themselves as key participants in the country’s defense sector, rather than addressing intransigent obstacles to women’s participation and rights."
Bulgaria,,1982,49,,1.247B,"NAP Development
A Consultative Working Group was established in 2019, and is led by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  The Working Group consists of experts from relevant government institutions, representatives of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and independent academic experts.  On 2 October 2019, the Working Group hosted a roundtable discussion in order to have a public consultation.  Development of Bulgaria’s NAP took place with the collaboration of Ireland, which shared its experience and expertise in WPS implementation. 
NAP Implementation
Implementation will be a joint effort among several institutions, including various ministries such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, Ministry of Youth and Sports, Ministry of Defence, and Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  Various military training academies and schools are also responsible for NAP implementation, including the Military Medical Academy, and G.S. Rakovski National Defence College.  Other actors include the Social Assistance Agency, the Child Protection Commission, the National Institute of Justice, the National Commission for Combating Trafficking in Human Beings, the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office of Appeals, the National Social Security Institute, and NGOs.
NAP monitoring and evaluation
Monitoring of the NAP will be a shared responsibility among institutions. ",The NAP will be implemented for the period 2020-2025.,"Bulgaria’s NAP is organized around four pillars. 
Prevention: preventing violence and promoting gender equality within law enforcement, peace and security processes (including non-violent conflict mediation and resolution), governmental policies, and the general public.  This pillar incorporates relevant strategic documents including the National Strategy for Promotion of Gender Equality.
Participation: promoting and supporting the active and effective participation of women in all peace processes and in formal and informal decision-making at all levels, as well as maintaining a policy of balanced gender representation in international and regional organizations.
Protection: strengthening efforts to ensure the safety, physical and mental health, wellbeing, economic security, and dignity of women and girls, to promote and protect women’s rights (including within the contexts of armed conflict and post-conflict reconstruction), and to mainstream gender equality.
Prioritization: relates to Bulgaria's contributions to the WPS agenda within the EU framework and the prioritization of WPS in the country’s commitments within NATO, the UN, multilateral and regional initiatives, including those in the field of arms control, non-proliferation and disarmament.","Each of the four pillars in Bulgaria’s NAP is divided into a subset of goals.  Each of these goals has a relevant set of measures, actions, and responsible institutions.  
For example, Pillar 3 of Protection contains three goals.  Goal 3.1., ‘Protection of the rights of women and girls during an armed conflict and in the post-conflict reconstruction process and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls’, is divided into five measures, including (p. 22): ‘3.1.2. Optimization of the funding and reporting of activities relating to gender equality in conflict-affected areas within the framework of development cooperation and humanitarian aid policy’. This has two associated actions.","Each action in Bulgaria’s NAP has a set of indicators and a timeframe.  For example, under Pillar 1 of Prevention, the action ‘Active involvement of women mediators in programmes and trainings for nonviolent resolution of disputes and conflicts’ includes four indicators, for example, the number of trainings and programmes implemented and the number of participating women mediators.  The timeframe for this action is 2020-2025.  ","The NAP states monitoring will be a shared responsibility among institutions and a review will begin in the second half of 2022 (p.4).  However, the NAP does not set out a specific monitoring and evaluation framework or process.","Each action within Bulgaria's NAP has an associated budget, however it is not specified in the document.  Rather, under budget, it states that the NAP will be implemented ‘Within the budget allocations for the relevant institutions’, in reference to the budget of listed responsible institutions.","Under Pillar 4 of Prioritization, Bulgaria’s NAP sets out that it will promote the principles of the WPS agenda within regional and multilateral initiatives on arms control, non-proliferation and disarmament (p. 28). "
Burkina Faso,"Burkina Faso has adopted a new National Action Plan (NAP) on WPS for the period 2023-2025. Analysis is forthcoming. Burkina Faso adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2012 for the period 2013-2016. The NAP was developed by the Ministry for Women’s Promotion and the Ministry of Human Rights and Civil Promotion. The NAP does not indicate civil society involvement in its development. The NAP identifies four overarching goals: protecting and rehabilitating women and girls who have been victims from violence; integrating a gender dimension in security and defence governance; preventing violence against women and girls; and raising awareness on violence against women and girls. These goals have corresponding objectives, actions, indicators, a monitoring and evaluation framework, and an estimated budget. Burkina Faso reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country provided the following updates (pp. 52-53): The establishment in 2014 of a working group on women peace and security in West Africa and the Sahel section of Burkina Faso, coordinated by the Ministry in charge of women; The establishment in 2015 of a national women’s unit of the G5 Sahel in charge of facilitating the integration and consideration of women’s specific priorities in order to contribute to the development and stability of the Sahel; Advocacy with the authorities for the involvement of women in peacekeeping operations; With a view to taking into account resolution 2242 of October 13, 2015 on strengthening actions in favor of the women, peace and security program, the national action plan for 2018 was reviewed. Burkina Faso gained independence from France in 1960, after decades of colonial rule by the French empire. The country experienced four military coups (1966, 1983, 1987, and 2015) after its independence, contributing to ongoing political instability. Since 2019, the clashes between armed Islamist groups and state security forces have exacerbated insecurity for the people of Burkina Faso. Currently, over 1 million people are internally displaced , while over 2.5 million people remain in humanitarian need. Furthermore, the proliferation of small arms and light weapons is contributing to the growing insecurity of women, including through an increase in gender-based violence. In 2019, Burkina Faso was among the top 10 countries in the world with the biggest increase in their military expenditure, with a 22% increase in its military spending.",1987,108,,358M,"NAP Development
Civil Society has not been explicitly mentioned as being involved in the development phase. Nevertheless, one of the objectives of the NAP is to increase cooperation between government agencies and civil society. 
The Ministry for Women’s Promotion, the Ministry of Human Rights and Civil Promotion were responsible for the development of this NAP. A discussion workshop was organized in order to challenge the initial drafts of the NAP and enhance its propositions.
NAP Implementation
Three organizations from civil society will be involved in the implementation phase, however, they have not been specified in the NAP.
The Ministry for Women’s Promotion will be responsible for the implementation of this NAP.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
Civil Society has not been explicitly mentioned as being involved in the monitoring phase.
A five-member Committee has been specifically created for monitoring the NAP. It is composed of members of the Ministry for Women’s Promotion. In addition to this Committee, the monitoring and evaluation will be run by: the National Assembly; the Prime Minister’s Cabinet; the Ministry of Defence and Veterans; the Ministry of Human Rights, the Ministry of Justice; the Ministry of Territorial Administration, Decentralization and Security; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Regional Cooperation; the Ministry of Social Action and Solidarity as well as the Ministry of the Civil Service, Labor and Social Security.
 Timeframe
The Burkina Faso NAP covers the period 2013-2016. The time frame is split into three periods: 2013-2014; 2014-2015; and 2015-2016. For each period, a table displays the timeframe for the implementation of each activity underlying the goal.",,"The NAP is structured by four goals and six objectives.  The following goals are:
Protecting and rehabilitating women and girls who have been victims from violence
Integrating a gender dimension in Security and Defence governance
Preventing violence against women and girls
Raising awareness on violence against women and girls
The NAP has six objectives which are:
Ensure and promote the systematic integration of the gender dimension in the process for human rights protection, justice and security reform.
Protect women and girls against sexual and gender-based violence
Prevent violence against women and girls through women’s rights promotion, accountability and law enforcement
Achieve women’s participation at all decision-making levels
Ensure parties involved in armed conflicts put an end to all forms of sexual violence against civilians and especially against women and girls
Ensure parties involved in armed conflict immediately take action to protect civilians, and especially women and girls, against all forms of sexual violence","Each objective relies on activities. For example, the first objective of the first goal is “Enhance care processes for women and girls who have been victims of violence”.  The activities for this objective include: 
Creating structures in the 13 counties to support and take care of victims
Strengthening the capacity of listening centers put in place by the OSC
Informing populations and raising their awareness on the existence of support structures and shelters for women and girls who have been victims of violence
Strengthening the capacity of health workers, security staff members and justice officials to enhance care processes for women and girls who have been victims of violence
Strengthen the OSC’s ability to create shelter for women and girls who have been victims of violence","A table summarizes which indicators will be used to track the progress on implementing a specific objective (i.e. not on the activity level, which means that the monitoring process will evaluate results on an objective level).
For instance, the following indicators have been defined for the first objective:
Enhancing care processes for women and girls who have been victims of violence
Number of teams created for gathering complaints, supporting and taking care of women and girls who have been victims of sexual-based violence
Number of women and girls who have been victims of sexual-based violence that are now being taken care of
Satisfaction level of the women and girls who are being taken care of
To be noted, some indicators are not quantifiable or qualitative. For instance, with laws protecting women and girls, monitors will only check for the existence of such laws and there are no explicit criteria for assessing it.
Monitoring and Evaluation
A table summarizes who is responsible for the implementation of each objective and the results expected for each objective. The bodies who will be in charge of the implementation are: the Ministry of Women’s Promotion, Ministry of National Defence and Veterans; Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Regional Cooperation; Ministry of National Education and Literacy; Ministry of Secondary and Higher Education; Ministry of Scientific Research and Information and Ministry of Human Rights and Civic Promotion. The sources for monitoring are also detailed.",,"The total budget for implementing this NAP is approximately $3.6mln (mentioned in CFA francs in the report), split as following: $1.3mln in 2014, $1.2mln in 2015 and $1.1mln in 2016. For each goal, a table displays the budget allocated to the implementation of each activity underlying the goal per year.",The NAP does not address disarmament.
Burundi,"Burundi adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2022 for the period 2022-2027. Based on the framework for the implementation of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000), the government of Burundi has developed and implemented two prior National Action Plans: the first, for the period 2012-2016 and the second for the period 2017-2021, and has adopted a third NAP for the period 2022-2027. The evaluation of the second NAP revealed that problems in Burundi persist regarding the women, peace and security agenda, particularly the full inclusion of women in peace-consolidation mechanisms and decision-making positions, as well as their economic independence and autonomy. The third NAP’s process of development was deeply intertwined with the second’s NAP evaluation. The Ministry of National Solidarity, Social Affairs, Human Rights and Gender was in charge of collecting and validating the data from 25 institutions and organizations that work on WPS, including Ministries and State Institutions, NGOs and financial and technical partners. Furthermore, four regional consultation workshops were held which identified the successes, obstacles encountered, challenges and recommendations that were the basis for the 2022-2027 Action Plan. Burundi’s NAP is structured around several axes: Promotion of UNSCR 1325 Equality and equity in men and women’s participation in decision-making positions and in peace-consolidation mechanisms Reinforce the legal framework for the prevention of conflicts and violence against women and girls Protection of rights and care for victims of sexual and gender-based violence Involvement of women and taking into account the needs of women and girls for the development and implementation of economic recovery programs Coordination and mobilization of financing for the implementation of NAP 2022-2027. Burundi gained independence from Belgium in 1962, after an extensive period of colonial rule by the Belgian empire. The most recent armed conflict in Burundi’s history is the civil war, which started in 1993 following a military coup. The conflict resulted in the death and displacement of thousands of people. The Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement was signed in 2000, where women’s civil society members acted as formal observers. In 2015, Burundi witnessed a failed coup attempt, which led to ongoing social and political instability in the country, including human rights violations perpetrated by security forces. On the ground, women have played a key role in working towards preventing further violence and conflict through their role as mediators. In 2017, the International Criminal Court (ICC) opened an investigation regarding crimes against humanity in Burundi. Burundi then became the first country to leave the ICC.",1992,,,66.8M,"Development
The Ministry of National Solidarity, Social Affairs, Human Rights and Gender was responsible for the development of the third Action Plan for Burundi. This was done with information gathered from CSOs, State Ministries and institutions and UN and African Union agencies in the country about the challenges and lessons learnt from the second NAP.

Cameroon,"Cameroon’s Second National Action Plan covers the years 2023 to 2027. The second NAP builds on the work conducted during the first NAP cycle and cites key lessons from the First-Generation NAP (2018-2020) that it seeks to address in the second NAP’s implementation. These include: the lack of a robust coordination mechanism, the need for a clearer framework for collaboration and oversight, funding challenges, low participation of women in formal processes, and minimal community ownership. The second generation NAP also cites positive steps forward, such as the increased representation of women in political decision-making roles, with more women elected and appointed to leadership positions; and e nhanced involvement of CSOs, particularly women-led organizations, in promoting the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda and advocating for gender equality. Cameroon adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2017 for the period 2018-2020. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Women’s Empowerment and the Family, with technical and financial support from UN Women and contributions from the public administrations, civil society organisations, and community leaders. The main data for identifying NAP priorities was compiled by WILPF Cameroon, which also played a crucial role in mobilising Women, Peace and Security (WPS) efforts across the country and developing the NAP. Cameroon gained independence from France in 1960, after an extensive period of colonial rule under the German, British, and French empires. In the current moment, Cameroon experiences political instability as a result of the spillover effects of conflicts in neighboring countries, internal attacks by Boko Haram, and uprisings across the English-speaking areas of the country. This instability has had a disproportionate impact on women and girls, specifically through the increase in gender-based violence as a result of the proliferation of small arms and light weapons.",1994,96,2014,422M,"Key Governmental Actors:

Canada,"Canada adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) for the period 2023-2029. This is preceded by two other NAPs, adopted in 2017 for the period 2017-2022 and in 2010 for the period 2010-2016. Compared to the 2017–2022 National Action Plan, the 2023–2029 Foundations for Peace introduces several changes that reflect both lessons learned and evolving global challenges. These include: Domestic Commitments: The 2023–2029 NAP includes more extensive domestic commitments than previous plans. These address emerging global issues that also have local impacts, such as the rise in climate emergencies and the increase in technology-facilitated gender-based violence. Notably, the plan specifically acknowledges threats targeting women peacebuilders and human rights defenders both in Canada and abroad. Deeper Engagement with Indigenous Communities: The NAP places greater emphasis on addressing gender-based discrimination, violence, oppression, and marginalization faced by women in Canada, particularly Indigenous women, girls, Two-Spirit, and gender-diverse people. It recognizes that leadership by Indigenous women and gender-diverse individuals is essential for achieving sustainable peace and security for all. Integration of an Intersectional Feminist Approach: Building on insights from previous plans, the 2023–2029 NAP further develops an intersectional feminist framework. In 2017, Canada adopted a Feminist International Assistance Policy. The policy’s core priority is identified as gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, with five additional supporting priorities: human dignity; growth that works for everyone; environment and climate action; inclusive governance; and peace and security. Canada is also a contributor to humanitarian aid, including being a contributing donor to the Women’s Peace and Humanitarian Fund , a global partnership that works to empower women in conflict zones and humanitarian crises. Canada is also a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies , a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. In 2019, Canada was UN Women ’s seventh-largest other resources contributor with USD 9.6 million and the tenth-largest total government contributor with USD 14.4 million. At the multilateral level, Canada was most recently a candidate for a non-permanent position at the United Nations Security Council for the period 2021-2022, but was not elected.",1981,30,2019,26.9B,"The 2023–2029 NAP was developed and will be implemented by 11 federal partners: the Canadian Armed Forces and Department of National Defence, Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada, Department of Justice Canada, Global Affairs Canada, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, Indigenous Services Canada, Public Safety Canada (including the Correctional Service of Canada), Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Veterans Affairs Canada, Women and Gender Equality Canada, and the Minister of Export Promotion, International Trade and Economic Development.
Additionally, the Minister for Women and Gender Equality and Youth plays an important oversight role in ensuring effective implementation across government.
Civil society organizations, including the Women, Peace and Security Network-Canada, co-chaired the advisory group and provided substantial input during the development process. The Government of Canada also engaged with Indigenous Peoples, women peacebuilders, human rights defenders, academics, and other civil society actors to shape a more inclusive and impactful action plan.",The National Action Plan covers the years from 2023 to 2029.,"Building and Sustaining Peace:
Strengthen gender-responsive and gender-transformative approaches to building and sustaining peace in Canada and abroad. This includes supporting women and gender-diverse peacebuilders and human rights defenders through targeted funding and policy support.
Security, Justice, and Accountability:
Improve security, justice, and accountability systems to better respond to the needs of women, girls, and gender-diverse people. This involves reforming security institutions to be more inclusive and addressing systemic harm.
Gender-Responsive Crisis Response:
Ensure crisis responses—both domestically and internationally—are gender-responsive. This includes integrating gender perspectives into disaster response, humanitarian aid, and peacekeeping operations.
Prevention and Response to Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV):
Enhance efforts to prevent and respond to sexual and gender-based violence, particularly in conflict and post-conflict situations, and strengthen accountability mechanisms for perpetrators.
Leadership and Capabilities:
Strengthen Canada’s leadership and capabilities to advance the WPS agenda. This involves building institutional capacity and leveraging Canada’s position in international organizations to champion gender equality and peace initiatives.
Inclusion:
Promote meaningful inclusion of marginalized and underrepresented groups, particularly Indigenous women, girls, Two-Spirit, and gender-diverse people, in peace and security efforts. The NAP integrates anti-racism, decolonization, and intersectionality across all focus areas.","Key actions under the 2023–2029 National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security (NAP) include the establishment of a dedicated coordination hub at Global Affairs Canada to lead and oversee the implementation of the NAP across all partner departments and agencies. The plan prioritizes strengthening partnerships with civil society organizations, particularly Indigenous communities, women peacebuilders, and gender-diverse groups, to ensure their meaningful participation in peace and security decision-making at all levels.
Additionally, the NAP commits to providing flexible and sustained funding to women’s rights organizations and feminist movements, both domestically and internationally, recognizing their critical role in advancing peace and security. The Government of Canada will further integrate gender perspectives into all aspects of military operations, security sector reforms, and crisis response planning, ensuring that interventions are inclusive and responsive to diverse needs.
The action plan also emphasizes building institutional capacity to address emerging global threats—such as climate-related security risks, cybersecurity threats, and technology-facilitated gender-based violence—through gender-responsive policies and practices.","Indicators for the NAP include a reduction in sexual and gender-based violence, increased participation of women and gender-diverse individuals in leadership roles, measurable improvements in the safety of peacebuilders and human rights defenders, and the implementation of flexible funding mechanisms for feminist movements.

The updated Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) framework focuses on fewer but more meaningful indicators, shifting from quantitative outputs to qualitative assessments that measure real impact and behavioral change.
This adaptive framework allows Canada to respond to emerging challenges and ensures that efforts are effectively supporting women, girls, and gender-diverse people in peace and security initiatives.","While specific budget details are not disclosed, the NAP emphasizes flexible funding models and resource commitments to support women’s rights organizations and peacebuilders. Funding will be channeled through established mechanisms, including the Peace and Stabilization Operations Program (PSOPs) at Global Affairs Canada, which provides targeted support for women, peace, and security initiatives in fragile and conflict-affected contexts. Additionally, the Government of Canada is dedicating specific resources for coordinating the action plan. This includes funding for interdepartmental coordination, strengthening partnerships with civil society and Indigenous organizations, and supporting the monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL) framework to ensure accountability and measure progress.","The NAP briefly references disarmament within its broader commitment to gender-sensitive security policies, specifically through approaches to arms control, mine action, and the inclusion of gender perspectives in security operations. However, disarmament is not a primary focus, appearing only once in the document.
Recognizing the critical role security and justice actors play in protecting civilians and preventing conflict, the NAP emphasizes the need to reform these sectors to address both historical and ongoing systemic harm. Central to this reform is the meaningful participation of women and gender-diverse people at all levels of decision-making and operations. Their inclusion strengthens responses to global security challenges, from arms control and mine action to emerging threats like climate security, cyber warfare, and chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear risks."
Central African Republic,"The Central African Republic (CAR) adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2014 for the period 2014-2016 and its second for the period 2019-2022. The second WPS NAP of the Central African Republic is based on a number of documents and policies relating to WPS and gender; these included the report of the implementation of the first WPS NAP, analysis of national and international legal instruments for the protection of women against gender-based violence, the study of the organizational structure and functioning modalities of the National Observatory on Equality between men and women, the proposals of some civil society and the network of parliamentarian women of Central African Republic, the diagnosis of the discrimination against women in CAR, and the study on the magnitude and forms of gender-based violence during crisis. Furthermore, the government of CAR collected data from key stakeholders who could participate in the implementation of the second action plan, including political-administrative authorities, pertinent services, leaders of the CSOs, Communitary Assistance Organizations (OACs) and feminist organizations. There are different challenges the government in CAR identified, including: The existence of discriminatory laws; Insufficient periodic reports on the implementation of international legal instruments; The persistence of insecurity in the country; Weak allocation of financial resources for the implementation of the NAP on UNSCR 1325; Lack of a grounded approach for gender-sensitive budgeting at the national and sectoral level; Lack of a national database of gender-based violence; Lack of a gender-sensitive Sectoral Strategy in the Defense and Security Forces; Insufficient synergy between the key stakeholders for the implementation of the NAP. The 2019-2022 CAR NAP has strategic axes that structure the document: Reinforcement of conflict prevention measures in order to avoid the emergence of violent conflicts and consolidation of peace; Full and meaningful participation and strong leadership of women in all efforts to maintain and promote peace and security; Strengthening protection to promote and protect human rights, specifically those of women, in times of peace, in times of conflict, and at all stages of conflict resolution; Recovery and transitional justice so that the specific needs of women and girls are guaranteed in all reconstruction processes in conflict or post-conflict situations, with particular attention to the most vulnerable (displaced and/or refugee women and girls, survivors of gender-based violence, women and girls with disabilities); Strengthening protection and security in the face of new human security threats. The Central African Republic reported on its WPS implementation in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). The Central African Republic gained independence from France in 1960, after decades of colonial rule. The most recent armed conflict in the history of the CAR is its ongoing civil war, which started in 2012. The conflict has displaced thousands of people and left millions in need of humanitarian aid. In 2014, the UN Security Council established the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic ( MINUSCA ) to ensure peace and stability in the country. Nevertheless, there have been several allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse by peacekeepers in the CAR.",1991,,2015,43.2M,"Development

Coordinate actions for peace-building, conflict prevention and resolution, in line with the Women, Peace and Security Agenda.","Each area of work has different actions assigned. For example, objective 1.3., “Guarantee the participation of women in the security and defense forces”, includes several actions:
Conduct a baseline survey to identify the presence of women in the Army.
Organize one advocacy session per year with high-ranking officials for the empowerment of women.
Organize three training sessions for men and women on resolution 1325.
Organize five awareness-raising sessions for the general general public for enrolment and participation of women and women and young women in the Chadian National Armée Nationale Tchadienne ","Each objective has a number of listed indicators. For example, objective 2.3, “Guarantee the protection of women activists and human rights defenders”, includes several indicators:
Raise awareness among 70% of safety authorities the role of women activists and women human rights defenders.
Promote (adopt) legal and political level protection of women activists and defenders of human rights, particularly at the judicial and political levels.","Several evaluations will be carried out as part of the NAP's implementation. The aim will be to take stock of implementation and the achievement of objectives specific criteria such as the evolution of indicators and financial financial performance. Two main evaluations will be carried out: An interim (mid-term) evaluation; and a final evaluation.
 ","The budget is divided into five parts. For participation, the budget is US$ 7 602 941,46; for protection, the budget is US$ 6 948 876,19; for prevention, the budget is US$ 3 037 119,83; for relief and recovery, the budget is US$ 7 912 576,84; for M&E, the budget is US$ 191 040,00 (split throughout the 5 years).","Objective 4.2, “guaranteeing access to justice for victims and survivors of conflict and violence” includes provisions on disarmament.

Chile,"Chile adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2015 for the period 2015-2018. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Relations, Ministry of National Defense, and the Ministry of Women and Gender Equity in consultation with civil society organizations. The NAP identifies its objectives based on the primary pillars of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) Agenda and seeks to incorporate a gender perspective across all activities; promote women’s meaningful participation in peace negotiations; protect the wellbeing of women and girls; and increase women’s access to recovery aid based on specific needs. The NAP is focused on national efforts to increase the roles of women in decision-making positions related to conflict prevention and overall gender mainstreaming. The includes indicators and a monitoring framework to evaluate implementation. The NAP does not include an allocated budget, and instead states that each coordinating institution is responsible for financing the identified activities through their annual budget. Chile’s second NAP is preceded by one other NAP adopted in 2009, without a specific timeframe of implementation. One of the objectives of the first NAP is “to consider Resolution 1325 as a general Chilean foreign policy objective, and incorporate its requirements into bilateral and multilateral activities” (p. 16). As such, the NAP approaches the implementation of the WPS agenda mostly internationally, focusing on conflict and post-conflict contexts as well as gender mainstreaming in peace and conflict matters, increasing women’s representation in overseas peacekeeping missions. In comparison to its first NAP, Chile’s second NAP has clearer indicators to monitor and assess if identified goals are reached. This revision was the result of a review conducted to assess the implementation of the first NAP, which found out that there was a need to create a more flexible and measurable action plan. Despite the improvements of its monitoring and evaluation framework, the updated NAP is similar in terms of its objectives, continuing to interpret WPS implementation mostly internationally. Chile does not have a history of recent armed conflict, but experienced a military coup in 1973, with subsequent military rule under Augusto Pinochet that lasted until 1990. The period of military dictatorship resulted in severe human rights violations, including forced disappearances , especially against the critics of the political regime. In 2019, Chile experienced country-wide protests emanating from the social and economic inequalities remnant of the Pinochet era. The protests resulted in a referendum that took place in 2020, with an overwhelming majority voting in favor of a new constitution. Feminist activists played a pivotal role leading up to the referandum, popularizing the slogans “never again without women” and “we are half, we want half” to demand that women hold equal representation in the constitutional convention. At the multilateral level, Chile most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2014-2015.",1989,57,2018,5B,"NAP Development
Certain non-governmental institutions  were included in the development of the NAP such as the National Institute for Human Rights, the Center for Human Rights (University of Chile) and the Regional Center for Human Rights. The updated NAP also claims to incorporate CSO recommendations; however, it is not explicitly mentioned which recommendations have been acted upon and which CSOs have submitted these recommendations. 
WILPF does not have a country section in Chile and therefore was not involved in the development process of Chile’s NAP.
The NAP was developed mainly by the Ministry of Foreign Relations, Ministry of National Defense, and the Ministry of Women and Gender Equity. Other actors were involved such as the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Interior, the National Academy of Political and Strategic Studies, the Joint Center for Peace Operations of Chile
NAP Implementation
Chile's NAP does not outline any CSO involvement in the implementation phase.
For the implementation of the NAP, the Ministry of Foreign Relations, Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Women and Gender Equity formed part of the implementation of the NAP
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
Unlike the previous NAP, this NAP specifies the roles of CSO in the monitoring  and evaluation of certain objectives related to the involvement of civil society. For example, for the objective “promoting the inclusion of  a gender perspective in all activities related to the construction, maintenance and consolidation of peace”, civil society organisations along with the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Women and Gender Equity and the Ministry of Foreign affairs will be responsible for  monitoring and evaluating the development and dissemination of standards of conduct to prevent the violation of the rights of women and girls in the development of peace operations.
The NAP will be monitored and evaluated annually by an Inter Ministerial committee made up of representatives of the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Women and Gender Equity.",The second NAP has been implemented for a period of four years 2015-2018.,"The main objectives of this second NAP is to implement four pillars of the WPS Agenda: prevention, participation, protection, relief and recovery. 
Prevention consists of incorporating a gender perspective in all activities and strategies aimed at preventing conflict and maintaining peace. This theme also focuses on the creation of mechanisms and effective institutions that will ensure a gender perspective in any efforts to prevent violence against women and girls. 
Participation consists of promoting and supporting the meaningful participation of women in all parts of peace processes and ensuring their representation in all levels of decision-making related to prevention and ending of conflict. It also includes strengthening the relationships between national and international organisations of women’s rights defenders. 
Protection focuses on strengthening and amplifying the measures taken to guarantee security, physical and mental integrity, sexual and reproductive health, well being, economic autonomy and the dignity of women and girls.  This aims to respect and guarantee the full exercise of the human rights of women and girls, while incorporating a gender perspective in the institutions that play a role in peace, conflict and post-conflict operations.
Relief and recovery pertains to the promotion of equal access for women to mechanisms and services for the distribution of aid, particularly those related to the specific needs of women and girls in all recovery efforts, such as during the transition of justice.",," Each objective of the NAP includes a system of indicators that serve to verify and control the implementation of each objectives in a foreseeable timeframe. For example, for the first objective related to prevention, more specifically, “Promote the inclusion of perspective of gender in all the activities of construction, maintenance and consolidation Peace”, the indicators are: - Number of thematic units training about gender, UNSCR 1325 as a system, International Instruments of Human Rights and/or International Humanitarian Law - Number of trainings  made on gender perspective in the pre-deployment and post-deployment
 ","The NAP will be monitored and evaluated annually by an Inter Ministerial committee made up of representatives of the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Women and Gender Equity.","Each coordinating institution must include in its annual budget an item destined to the financing of the activities that correspond to them according to the objectives of this NAP. Likewise, it is recommended to consider the aforementioned item to the participating institutions.",There is no mention of disarmament in the updated NAP.
Cote Divoire,"The first National Action Plan (NAP) of Côte d’Ivoire on UNSCR 1325 (2000) was in place during the period 2008-2012. This was in the middle of  a political and military crisis that extended from September 2002 until 2010, and then a subsequent crisis surrounding the 2010 elections until the resolution of the conflict in April 2011. The development of Côte d’Ivoire’s second NAP (2019-2023) was based on the report of evaluation of the first Ivorian NAP, the general observations of the Committee for the elimination of discrimination against women, the National Plan of Development, and other reports regarding the Women, Peace and Security agenda. Mitigating the potential risks of renewed armed conflict and preventing future violence are main priorities for the Ivorian NAP, as well as the need to strengthen the national system for protection against violence. Côte d’Ivoire reported on the implementation of its NAP in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Côte d’Ivoire gained independence from France in 1960, after decades of colonial rule by the French empire. The most recent armed conflict in the history of Côte d’Ivoire is the civil war, which lasted from 2002 until 2007, resulting in the division of the country into the Muslim rebel-held north and government-controlled Christian south. Following the civil war, Côte d’Ivoire has seen political unrest, election-related violence, resurgent armed conflict, and grave human rights abuses, including the political unrest in 2011. Conflict in Côte d’Ivoire has disproportionately affected women and girls, who represent the majority of victims, internally displaced persons, and refugees. Though women were actively involved in organizing peacebuilding efforts, they were excluded from formal peace negotiation processes. Nevertheless, women played a key role in the post-conflict reconstruction process, including their involvement in the country’s truth and reconciliation efforts.",1995,,2015,604M,"Development
The Ministry of Women, the Family and Children was responsible for developing the new NAP, with the help of other partners, such as UN Women and the Canada Embassy in Côte d’Ivoire through the Group of Friends of the Guinean Gulf. The NAP states that this was a participatory and interactive process that gathered together all stakeholders involved in the protection of the rights of women and girls, including public authorities, civil society organizations (CSOs) and technical and financial partners.
Implementation
The Ministry of Women, the Family and Children is the government entity responsible for the implementation of the Action Plan; such work must be done through the lead of the National Coordinating Committee of the NAP.
The National Coordinating Committee of the NAP includes representatives of the Ministries of Defense, Interior, Justice and Finances, the Technical and Financial Partners, CSOs and other relevant institutions. Among its responsibilities are:
Coordinating the implementation of the activities listed in the NAP
Defining the national priorities regarding the NAP
Examining the reports of activities and monitoring the implementation of the Action Plan.
A Permanent Technical Secretariat will be in charge of the implementation of the NAP, made out of technical personnel exclusively dedicated to this mission. Among its functions are:
Implement and monitor the activities of the NAP 
Provide technical support to stakeholders
Elaborate the reports of implemented activities, as established in the NAP
Prepare the annual plans on the implementation of the NAP 
Support the mobilization of resources.
Monitoring and Evaluation
The Ministry of Women, the Family and Children is also responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of the NAP. This task will be completed through the National Coordinating Committee and the Permanent Technical Secretariat.
Civil Society
According to the Action Plan, civil society will participate in all the steps of the NAP: development, implementation and monitoring and evaluation. The NAP states that due to their experience on the ground, the government considers CSOs to be a key stakeholder when it comes to support and awareness. Specifically, it states that they can boost women’s participation in all levels of conflict prevention and peace consolidation in Côte d’Ivoire, they play a key role in early warning and prevention of violence against women and girls, and their participation is needed for the effective implementation of the NAP.
To ensure such participation, the WPS Platform for CSOs was proposed as a framework for consultation and exchange between the  state and civil society. The Coordinating National Committee will establish this platform in line with the National Strategy against Gender-based Violence.",The Second NAP for Côte d’Ivoire is established for the period 2019-2023.,"The main objective of the Ivorian Action Plan is to improve the role and the position of women in the peace and security architecture in Côte d’Ivoire through the reinforcement of the mechanisms of promotion and protection dedicated to women and children in periods of conflict and post-conflict.
 The specific objectives of the NAP are:
Reduce the risk of conflict and eliminate violence against women and children in the period of conflict and post-conflict.
Increase the participation and contribution of women to mechanisms of mediation, peace consolidation, and the post-crisis reforms.
Efficiently protect women and children against gender-based violence (GBV)  and sexual violence during conflict. 
Ensure the effective coordination, financing, dissemination and the monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the NAP on UNSCR 1325
 Moreover, each specific objective has desired effects, some examples are
1.1 The security and peace keeping forces efficiently prevent sexual violence in conflict and gender-based violence
2.2. The needs of women and girls in terms of reinsertion and reparation are satisfied by the peacekeeping programs.
3.2 Women and girls are protected from sexual and gender-based violence within the communities
 ","Côte d’Ivoire’s Action Plan is structured to tackle the secondary objectives and desired effects through a list of actions that address specific situations, with the purpose of increasing women’s participation in all areas of the security sector, considering their needs and incorporating them in the government strategies. Examples of the actions listed include:
1.1.1.1 Reinforce the operational capacities of the National Committee to Fight against Sexual Violence in Conflict
1.2.1.2 Train women and girls in extremism and radicalization prevention.
2.2.1.1 Evaluate and reinforce the level of integration of a gender perspective in security sector reform programs
3.1.1.3 Implement mechanisms (local and national) for the humanitarian coordination of response to gender-based violence in periods of conflict.
3.3.1.2 Adoption of a General Law on the Elimination of all forms of Gender-Based Violence
 ","The Ivorian NAP has quantitative and qualitative indicators, linked to both the desired effects and the actions enlisted in the document. Indicators on the desired effects include:
1.1 The level of incidents of gender-based violence and sexual violence in conflict in the within the security and peace keeping forces is reduced
1.2 Number and percentage of women and girls involved in the fight against violent extremism and radicalization
2.1 Number and percentage of the women involved in the peacekeeping and peace consolidation mechanisms
2.2. Proportion of objectives targeting the needs of women and girls
3.2 Rate of reduction of the prevalence of GBV incidents, particularly rape.
 Examples of indicators regarding activities include
1.1.1.1 Affected resources/ type of activities/ frequence of the reports
1.2.1.2 Number of the women who are trained on extremism and radicalization prevention
2.2.1.1 Evaluation report of the gender perspective in the reform of the security sector program availability.
3.1.1.3 Number of the mechanism created to coordinate the humanitarian response to GBV during conflict
3.3.1.2 Availability of the General Law against GBV","The Permanent Technical Secretariat and the Coordinating National Committee are responsible for NAP monitoring and evaluation.
The everyday monitoring of the members and activities of the NAP will be done by the Permanent Technical Secretariat through the collection of data directly from the ground.
The PTS will also support the matrix for measuring the performance, needed for the elaboration of a detailed plan of monitoring and the production of activity reports each six and twelve months, to examine the progress in the implementation of the NAP. The monitoring will be done based on the indicators defined in the NAP’s Matrix.
The Coordinating Committee will be in charge of the internal evaluations, based on the results presented by the PTS, and will examine all reports of activities, with the goal of making any necessary changes in the strategy. ","The NAP details that CFCA 1 963 000 000 is needed for the implementation. The Ivorian government is the main source of financing, but UN Women, PNUD, UNFPA, the Canadian Embassy in Côte d’Ivoire and other partners will also support.","The Ivorian NAP recognizes the key role disarmament plays within the foundational structure of UNSCR 1325 and the need to include a gender perspective in any disarmament program. Furthermore, it acknowledges the role the DDR program implemented in 2011 as a part of the Emergency Presidential Program in Côte d’Ivoire, which helped reinsert former combatants and strengthened the social cohesion, and improved the stabilization and pacification of the country.
Additionally, the 2014 National Strategy for the Fight Against Gender-Based Violence recognizes Security Sector Reform and DDR as a key intervention axis. Nonetheless, the NAP does not have specific actions or objectives regarding disarmament."
Croatia,"Croatia adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2019 for the period 2019-2023. Croatia’s Second National Action Plan for Women, Peace, and Security was developed by the Government of the Republic of Croatia in collaboration with a Working Group that was specifically tasked with developing the plan. Croatia’s second NAP, NAP II, mimics the structure of NAP I in its objective and measures in the areas of prevention, participation and protection, and post-conflict recovery; however it also identifies new priorities in strengthening implementation and monitoring. NAP II’s development considers new Security Council resolutions on women, peace, and security that address challenges such as climate, migration, and terrorism (p. 7). The Working Group, chaired by the assistant minister for Multilateral Global Issues, operates under the guidance of the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs. Croatia’s Working Group membership includes appointed representatives of sectoral bodies and the representatives of the Office of the President of the Republic of Croatia and those of the Ombudsman for Gender Equality (p.7). Croatia’s second NAP is preceded by one other NAP, adopted in 2011 and implemented for the period 2011-2014. The NAP was developed by an interdepartmental working group coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration. Civil society actors were invited to provide input to the drafted NAP, but had no representation in the Working Group that was responsible for the NAP’s development. The NAP identifies nine strategic objectives, grouped under thematic pillars: prevention; participation; protection and post-conflict recovery; and implementation and monitoring. These objectives include increasing women’s representation in decision-making processes related to peace and security; promoting and protecting the rights of women and girls in conflict and post-conflict settings; and improving cooperation in implementing Resolution 1325, among others. Croatia reported on the implementation of its NAP, the development of the second NAP, and other WPS commitments in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Croatia declared and gained independence in 1991 and 1995, respectively, followed by an independence war (1991-1995) that took place between the Croat forces and Serbian Yugoslav People’s Army. The conflict contained numerous human rights violations, including indiscriminate targeting of civilian areas, ethnic cleansing, and sexual violence used as a weapon of war. The conflict led to the death and displacement of thousands of people. During the war, women played a key role in antimilitarist and humanitarian efforts, including establishing anti-war groups, operating hotlines for victims of the war, and setting up women’s shelters. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was established in 1993 to prosecute crimes committed during the Yugoslav Wars, including those in Croatia. In 2015, the Croatian parliament passed a law that recognized the rights of victims of sexual violence during the war, which will provide survivors with a monthly stipend as well as access to free counseling and legal and medical aid. At the multilateral level, Croatia most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2008-2009.",1992,60,2014,1.009B,"NAP Development 
On 18 January 2018, the Government of the Republic of Croatia adopted the “Decision on the establishment of a Working Group for developing the NAP for Implementing Security Council Resolution 1325 (2000) on WPS and related Resolutions”. Croatia’s Second National Action Plan for Women, Peace, and Security (2019-2023) was developed by the Government of the Republic of Croatia in collaboration with this Working Group. Croatia’s second NAP, NAP II, mimics the structure of NAP I in its objective and measures in the areas of prevention, participation and protection, and post-conflict recovery; however it also identifies new priorities in strengthening implementation and monitoring.

Croatia’s Working Group membership includes appointed representatives of sectoral bodies and the representatives of the Office of the President of the Republic of Croatia and those of the Ombudsman for Gender Equality (p.7). The National Action Plan on Women Peace and Security does not explicitly mention civil society in its development, however, the NAP states that civil society groups and organizations were invited to collaborate with facilitators of relevant measures within different objectives (p. 12-18). During the consultation process, between December 2019 and January 2019, the NAP states that interested groups and stakeholders had the opportunity to express opinions and proposals.
NAP Implementation
The implementation and monitoring of NAP II was conducted by the Working Group, which will assemble as needed, at least once a year to review the annual report on implementation of NAP measures. The Working Group will submit, to the Croatian Government, a biannual report on the implementation of NAP measures and information on implementation will be provided upon request to relevant international organisations (p.20). 
At the national level, emphasis has been placed on strengthening interest and improving capacities of institutions involved as well as other stakeholders, including the wider Croatian public, so that a comprehensive gender-sensitive approach to security can be implemented (p.8). Special emphasis has been placed on measures pertaining to education and training, especially in areas of prevention (p.8). In regard to foreign policy, the Republic of Croatia will continue active engagement within the framework of the Group of Friends of UNSCR 1325 and encourage the implementation of gender-sensitive foreign, security, defense, and development policy in accordance with membership commitments from the EU and NATO (p.8).  
Implementation measures have been divided into the following categories:
Prevention - measures will be implemented and aimed at strengthening gender perspectives through (i) documents, international activities and communicating with public and (ii) education and training programs. 
Participation - (i) introducing gender balance in the activities of the security and defense sector and (ii) increase representation of women in decision-making activities and processes concerning peacebuilding and security (p. 8) 
Protection and post-conflict recovery - (i) implement protection of women and girls’ rights - war victims in the Republic of Croatia with a view to their post-conflict recovery with the measures modified to a lesser extent. (p.8) 
Two other objectives were focused on external action (ii) promotion of the protection of the rights of women and girls - victims of gender-based violence in the areas of armed conflict and (iii) orienting developmental cooperation towards protection and empowerment of women in accordance with the National Development Cooperation Strategy (2017-2021) (p.9) 
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
The Working Group is tasked with analysing and evaluating the results of the implementation of NAP I measures and drafting the proposal of the new National Action Plan. The Working Group has two objectives regarding (i) the improvement of cooperation in implementing UNSRs on WPS and (ii) monitoring the implementation of UNSCRs. These objectives are strengthened through consistent monitoring measures and through regular reporting to the Government of the Republic of Croatia (p.9). A description of measures for implementation and monitoring are included in pages 18 -20 of the NAP. ",The NAP will be implemented for the period 2019-2023.,"Croatia’s second National Action Plan contains a new chapter - Security Risk Management - which introduces two new objectives: (i) gender-sensitive approach in managing security risks of natural and technological disasters and terrorism and (ii) promoting protection of women and girl refugees, asylum seekers and migrants, with measures elaborated within each of the two objectives (p.9) 
Implementation and monitoring contain two objectives: (i) improvement of cooperation in implementing UNSCRs on WPS and (ii) monitoring the implementation of UNSCRs. (p.9)
Both objectives are strengthened through additional measures, especially in relations to the local level of implementation and more consistent monitoring of measures within the framework of the Working Group, as well as regular reporting to the Government of the Republic of Croatia on the results (p.9)

Czech Republic,"The Czech Republic adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2017 for the period 2017-2020. The NAP was developed through a participatory process that involved the Government Council for Gender Equality, which consisted of representatives from the government, academia and civil society, and several ministries, including the Ministries of Defense; Foreign Affairs; and Interior. The NAP has seven overarching goals that address balanced representation of women and men in decision-making positions; reconciliation between work and private life; education and training; international cooperation for the promotion of the WPS Agenda; dignity and integrity of women; current challenges for the implementation of the WPS Agenda; and institutional support for gender equality. Each objective has corresponding actions, indicators, and coordinating entities. Nevertheless, the NAP does not include an allocated budget. The Czech Republic reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country provided the following updates, among others: The Action Plan on the Implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution 1325, on Women, Peace, and Security for 2017 – 202034 was adopted under the Resolution of the Government of the Czech Republic No. 12 of 9 January 2017. The Resolution 1325 Action Plan 2017 – 2020 is closely linked with the Government Strategy and is considered to be its implementation document. To oversee the implementation of Resolution 1325 Action Plan 2017 – 2020, the Working Group on the WPS Agenda was established at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (p. 22). The Resolution 1325 Action Plan 2017 – 2020 is not the only document on the WPS agenda that was adopted in the Czech Republic during the monitored period. In 2016, the Command of the Minister of Defence on Promoting Gender Equality within the Ministry of Defence (hereinafter also the “Command of the Minister of Defence”)35 was adopted. The Command of the Minister of Defence sets various orders to bodies of the Ministry of Defence with the purpose to advance gender equality. The orders include reviewing internal procedures and regulations to ensure that they are in compliance with gender equality, holding training on gender equality for the Ministry of Defence personnel, and collecting sex-segregated data (p. 23). The Czech Republic became an independent state in 1993 following the peaceful dissolution of Czechoslovakia. The country does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but contributes to overseas military operations and peacekeeping missions. The Czech Republic is also a contributor to humanitarian aid, including as a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies , a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. In 2019, the Czech Republic was among the top 25 arms exporters in the world.",1993,78,2014,3B,"NAP Development
Civil society organisations were present in the process of NAP development through their participation in the Government Council for Gender Equality. 
This NAP has been developed through a participatory process that involved the Government Council for Gender Equality, that consists of representatives from the government, academia and civil society, as well as several ministries, including the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Interior.                                  
NAP Implementation
Civil society organisations will be present in the process of NAP implementation through their participation in the Government Council for Gender Equality.
Domestically, relevant ministries are the leading actors in the implementation of the Czech NAP in relevant categories, as described in the NAP. Internationally, the implementation of the NAP is undertaken by educational facilities, such as Charles University in Prague, as well as inter- and non-governmental organisations, including Caritas and CARE.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation

This is done with a view to ensure that relevant bodies will be able to respond to ongoing challenges and problems arisen in connection with the implementation of the WPS Agenda.","There is no specific section allocated to the issue of NAP financing. However, throughout the NAP, there are several references to financial resources and their allocation. For example, the Ministry of Interior is expected to support its research and other initiatives through by applying to grants and with support of the EU-led Funds.","The NAP includes an objective aimed at ensuring that different needs of female and male ex-combatants and their dependents are taking into consideration in the process of preparation and implementation of DDR programs. At the same time, the Czech NAP showcases the intention of the Government to re-frame women’s role in society so that women see themselves as key participants in the country’s defense sector, rather than addressing intransigent obstacles to women’s participation and rights."
Democratic Republic Of The Congo Drc,"The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2018 for the period 2019-2022. The DRC’s second NAP provides a detailed overview that evaluates the implementation of the first NAP, addressing positive developments and ongoing challenges. The NAP is in tandem with the country’s National Gender Policy with its focus on advancing women’s and girls’ human rights during and after conflict and working against impunity for crimes perpetrated against women and girls. A post-conflict recovery framework also marks the NAP, as the document states that the general objective of the country’s second action plan is “to promote a secure environment that guarantees the fair inclusion of women, men and young people in consolidating peace in the DRC” (p. 10). The NAP identifies 11 objectives, which are compiled under four thematic priority axes: inclusion; prevention; protection; and recovery. While the NAP has a detailed implementation matrix, with specific actions and indicators, it does not have an allocated budget. The DRC’s second NAP is preceded by one another NAP, adopted in 2010, without a specific period of implementation. The DRC’s second NAP includes a standalone chapter that serves as a status report for the findings of the implementation of the first NAP, including lessons learned and best practices. Specifically, the NAP states that implementation suffered from a “low awareness of NAP among the general public; poor uptake of NAP by the government; weak support from partners in the implementation of the NAP; and non-inclusion and lack of integration of young women and women living with disability [sic] in the implementation of the NAP,” among others (p. 17). As such, the second NAP is more detailed and substantive, with the inclusion of an implementation matrix that incorporates quantifiable measures into the action plan. Furthermore, the second NAP highlights the importance of disarmament by including “control and reduction of the circulation of small arms and light weapons” as an objective under the second priority axis of prevention. The DRC reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country included the following among its achievements (p. 46): The establishment of the national secretariat for the implementation of Resolution 1325 in 2015 for better coordination; The establishment of Provincial Secretariats 1325 in 21 out of 26 provinces; The strengthening of the capacities of various members of these committees at both the national and provincial levels; The participation of women in the various dialogues, particularly the OAU City Dialogue or the African Union City Agreement for the organization of peaceful, credible and transparent elections in the DRC (61 women out of 262 participants or 23.2%); global and inclusive political agreement of the interdiocesan center commonly known as the CENCO Agreement or New Year’s Eve Agreement (3 women out of 29 participants or 10.3%); Since 2017, the country has been working to install community early warning mechanisms in the 26 provinces of the DRC, which include men and women of all categories. In addition, as part of police reform, the DRC is striving to expand the establishment of local security councils that include men and women in the prevention and fight against insecurity. The DRC gained independence from Belgium in 1960, after decades of colonial rule. The country went through a civil war that lasted from 1997 and 2003, resulting in five million casualties. Women were disproportionately impacted by wartime atrocities, with mass rape used as a weapon of war. The DRC has since experienced sporadic acts of violence that continue to mark everyday life in the country. Armed groups are still active in the country’s eastern provinces, and the political situation in the DRC remains volatile due to the uncontrolled flow of small arms and light weapons into the country. In 2019, UNHCR noted that there are over 5 million internally displaced people inside the DRC, while, as of February 2020, over 918,000 refugees and asylum seekers from the DRC were being hosted in African countries.",1986,149,,295M,"NAP Development
The NAP indicates that representatives of civil society were included in a workshop organized to evaluate the country’s first NAP and provide recommendations for the second version. However, the NAP does not specify which civil society organizations were present during this evaluation process. 
WILPF DRC was involved in the creation of DRC’s NAP by collaborating with the National Secretariat 1325 in organizing two high-level workshops in November 2016 and March 2017 to discuss the roadmaps that would lead to the drafting of DRC’s second NAP.
The development of the NAP was spearheaded by the Ministry of Gender, Family and Children in collaboration with government and civil society representatives as well as technical experts. 
 NAP Implementation
The NAP includes civil society organizations among the actors that are tasked with implementing some of the objectives. However, the document does not specify which civil society organizations will be represented or how they will contribute to the implementation. 
The NAP identifies a national coordination mechanism, which consists of the Steering Committee, the National Secretariat, and the 1325 Trust Fund, to coordinate the implementation of the NAP. The National Secretariat will be responsible for the day-to-day and overall implementation of the NAP. 
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
The NAP indicates that the Steering Committee will be responsible for compiling reports on the NAP’s implementation. Both the national Steering Committee and the Provincial Steering Committee will include representatives from civil society. However, the NAP does not specify what the role of the civil society representatives will be. 
The NAP identifies a national coordination mechanism, which consists of the Steering Committee, the National Secretariat, and the 1325 Trust Fund, to coordinate the implementation of the NAP. The Steering Committee, which is mostly composed of government representatives from various ministries, is responsible for compiling the periodic and annual reports on the NAP’s implementation.",The implementation period of the NAP is three years (2019-2022).,"The NAP identifies 11 objectives, compiled under the four pillars of UNSCR 1325: participation (referred to in the NAP as “inclusion”), prevention, protection, and recovery. On DRC’s NAP, inclusion has two objectives, prevention has five objectives, protection has two objectives, and recovery has two objectives listed. For example, objective #2 listed under inclusion is: “Helping to raise to 20% the inclusion rate of women and young women in decision-making bodies of socio-political, economic, public and private institutions” (p. 19). ","The NAP has a detailed implementation matrix that breaks down each objective with corresponding anticipated results, indicators, activities, and actors. For example, objective #2 listed under inclusion identifies, “Advocacy to authorities for effective implementation of commitments to promote the inclusion of women in political governance” as one of the activities listed under this objective (p. 28, implementation matrix).  ","The NAP identifies several indicators for each objective, outlined on the implementation matrix. For example, objective #2 listed under inclusion identifies, “Percentage of women and young women within decision-making bodies” and “Number of laws revised to be gender-sensitive” as two of the four indicators listed under this objective (p. 28, implementation matrix).","The NAP identifies a national coordination mechanism, which consists of the Steering Committee, the National Secretariat, and the 1325 Trust Fund, to coordinate the implementation of the NAP. The Steering Committee is responsible for compiling the periodic and annual reports on the NAP’s implementation. However, the NAP does not provide further information on how the monitoring and evaluation will be conducted.","The NAP does not contain an allocated or estimated budget. However, the NAP does indicate that a Trust Fund has been set up to obtain financial support for the implementation of the WPS Agenda. The NAP indicates that the Fund will be funded by the government and donors as well as receiving contributions from technical and financial partners.","The NAP does not address disarmament in its objectives or scope of implementation. However, DRC’s Ministry of Defense, Disarmament and Veterans is tasked with implementing several objectives."
Denmark,"Denmark adopted its fourth National Action Plan (NAP) in 2020 for the period 2020-2024. The main inter-ministerial working group for the NAP is composed of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, the Danish Ministry of Defence, the Danish Ministry of Justice (the Danish National Police). All of these ministries will also develop implementation plans for the NAP. The NAP states that Denmark will invite all interested civil society actors to participate in NAP implementation, and this will be coordinated in the annual forum and through thematic working groups that will be developed. The overall goal of Denmark’s new action plan is to ensure the full, equal and meaningful participation of women in peace efforts (from prevention and conflict management, to peacebuilding and sustaining peace), and to incorporate the consideration of women and men’s equality, rights, interests, vulnerabilities and needs into all aspects of the work for sustainable peace. Several countries/regions are specifically highlighted in the NAP: Iraq, the Sahel region, Afghanistan, Syria, and Somalia. Denmark’s fourth NAP is preceded by three other NAPs, adopted in 2005, 2008, and 2014 and implemented for the period 2005-2007, 2008-2013, and 2014-2019, respectively. Denmark’s second and third NAPs are significantly longer and more substantive than its first NAP. Furthermore, both the second and third NAPs have standalone sections dedicated to providing an overview of the “lessons learned” from the implementation of the previous NAPs. While the first NAP does not specifically identify actors involved in the development, implementation, and monitoring of the NAP, the second NAP places particular importance on the role of civil society and nongovernmental organizations in the implementation of the NAP. In particular, the NAP states that “broad national ownership of the revised NAP has been achieved through a substantial consultative process” (p. 33). Furthermore, the third NAP identifies working with women’s organizations “to ensure women’s representation in (i) peace and state building processes at community, regional and national levels and (ii) political, democracy and civil society processes and institutions” (p. 11) as a primary goal. Denmark reported on the implementation of its NAP in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Denmark does not have a history of recent armed conflict, but is involved in overseas military operations, international peacekeeping, and humanitarian missions. In 2019, Denmark extended the suspension of its arms exports to include the United Arab Emirates, in addition to Saudi Arabia. Denmark is a major contributor to humanitarian aid, with Danish NGOs playing an active mission in the country’s humanitarian assistance framework. Denmark is a member of the Nordic Women Mediators Network, which was launched in 2015. Denmark is also a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies , a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. At the multilateral level, Denmark most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2005-2006.",1983,14,2014,4.5B,"The fourth Danish National Action Plan will be implemented for the period 2020-2024. The main working group for the NAP is composed of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, the Danish Ministry of Defence, the Danish Ministry of Justice (the Danish National Police). All of these ministries will also develop implementation plans for the NAP. 
Civil Society
The NAP states that these ministries will coordinate with civil society, and will hold an annual forum to discuss the NAP. Per the evaluation of the previous NAP, Denmark found that there was a need to increase competency on the WPS agenda within ministries, in order to better implement and follow up on the NAP (pg. 32). As a result, actors will undergo joint training and coordination. 
The NAP states that Denmark will invite all interested civil society actors to participate in NAP implementation, and this will be coordinated in the annual forum and through thematic working groups that will be developed (pg. 11).  It states that “the aim and purpose of these working groups will be established in collaboration with civil society, and the implementation plans for ministries should be the starting point for these discussions.”
Monitoring and Evaluation
The NAP states that the plan will be regularly re-assessed. This fourth NAP was developed based on the evaluation of the third NAP. There will be an annual evaluation of the NAP and adaptation of its goals and priorities according to this evaluation. This will be conducted in the format of an annual forum.
WILPF Denmark advocated for this fourth Danish NAP to be feminist and peace-oriented, and were part of a consortium of Danish NGOs, researchers, and other organisations advocating for peace within the NAP. They will continue to participate in this consortium and will monitor the implementation of the NAP. ",The NAP will be implemented for the period 2020-2024.,"The overall goal of Denmark’s new action plan is to ensure the full, equal and meaningful participation of women in peace efforts (from prevention and conflict management, to peacebuilding and sustaining peace), and to incorporate the consideration of women and men’s equality, rights, interests, vulnera- bilities and needs into all aspects of the work for sustainable peace. Several countries/regions are specifically highlighted in the NAP: Iraq, the Sahel region, Afghanistan, Syria, and Somalia.
There are three main pillars of the NAP: Denmark as a security policy actor; Women’s participation in peace and security; and Sexual and gender-based violence in conflict situations and efforts against sexual exploitation, abuse, and harassment. Under each of these pillars there are goals identified. ","There is a results framework which lays out specific actions and activities under the three main goals. Furthermore, the NAP identifies that there will be specific implementation plans for each of the relevant ministries [the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark, the Danish Ministry of Defence, and the Danish Ministry of Justice (the Danish National Police)]. 
Under Goal 1, there are two sub-goals: Goal 1.1: A stronger gender perspective in international operations, missions and peace and stabilisation efforts, and Goal 1.2: A stronger Danish voice in multilateral security policy cooperation for the benefit of women, peace and security. Under Goal 1.1 there is a case study on Denmark’s work on Iraq, and under Goal 1.2, which focuses on NATO, the EU, and the UN, there is a case study on the Sahel region.
Under Goal 2, there are two sub-goals: Goal 2.1: Strengthen women’s participation in global peace and security efforts, and Goal 2.2: Strengthen Danish women’s participation in peace and security efforts. Goal 2.1 has a case study on Afghanistan and identifies that Nordic cooperation and support for Danish NGOs and women’s networks will be some priorities.
Under Goal 3, there are two sub-goals: Goal 3.1: Prevention and response to sexual and gender-based violence in conflict situations and fragile contexts and Goal 3.2: Zero tolerance for sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment among our partners and in Danish ranks. Work on Syria and Somalia is specifically highlighted, as is the Danish commitment to sexual and reproductive health and rights.","There are a number of outcomes indicated under the different goals and objectives identified above, within the results framework. More specific indicators will be identified in the implementation plan.  
Examples of outcomes under goal 2 include: 
2.1.1. Denmark has contributed to eliminating fundamental barriers to the participation of women by contributing to increased security for women and girls in conflict areas and fragile contexts.
2.1.2. Denmark has promoted the participation and engagement of women in peace and security efforts, political decision-making processes and local issues in the areas where Denmark is present, and has strengthened the dialogue with local women actors at all levels. ","The National Action Plan articulates that it has been developed based on the findings of the evaluation of the Third NAP. It found that “ the last two action plans had only made limited contributions to concrete results in Denmark’s partner countries, and that the resolution had slipped out of view in Danish strategies and country programmes.”
The previously mentioned 2019 evaluation of the two most recent Danish WPS action plans concluded that there was a need for increased competency; a sense of fatigue on gender equality; and that there was insufficient incorporation of civil society. 
The NAP states that there will be “Ongoing follow-up, annual evaluation and agile adaptation of the action plan and respective implementation plans will ensure that the plan leads to tangible results for women and girls living in crisis and conflict areas, and thereby for the societies where Denmark is actively involved” (pg.11).","The NAP does not specifically reference a budget, although one section speaks about the Peace and Stabilisation Fund, which primarily finances Denmark’s efforts for peacebuilding and stabilisation. Page 14 states that the fund will increasingly focus on strengthening WPS, and that future evaluations and programmes of the fund will assess how activities can incorporate gender perspectives and make an impact on the ground. ","The NAP calls for the need to mainstream gender within disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) processes but otherwise does not reference disarmament or recognize the negative impacts of weapons on women’s security."
Djibouti,,1998,,2013,,"The Ministry of Women and Family (MFF) is the government institution responsible for the NAP at all stages.
Development
The development of the Action Plan proceeded in three stages:
Research and documentary analyses were carried out, as well as qualitative interviews with key institutions and organizations regarding the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda.
A workshop on the NAP draft was held, in which participants of related institutions discussed, amended, and made proposals to finalize the document.
The final stage was the launching of the NAP as a whole.
Implementation
Although the Ministry of Women and Family is the main initiator of the NAP, the document recognizes that the implementation is a shared responsibility among all the institutions cited in the Action Plan, to ensure that all programmed actions and activities are realized within the timeframe.
The participants in the implementation process include the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, the Ministry of Justice, the National Commission of Human Rights, the Center of Studies and Research of Djibouti, the National Union of Djiboutian Women (UNFD), the National Assembly, The University of Djibouti,  feminist associations, non-governmental organizations, and others.
Monitoring and Evaluation
The Monitoring and Evaluation Process will be led by a special committee that will include personnel from the stakeholders that participated in the development and implementation of the NAP. This includes the National Assembly, the Ministry of Women and Family (MFF), the Ministry of Justice and Penitentiary Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, the Ministry of Interior, The Department of Defense, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the National Commission for Human Rights, the Djibouti Social Development Agency, the National Office for Assistance to Refugees and Victims, the Center for Study and Research of Djibouti, the University of Djibouti, the National Union of Djiboutian Women, NGOs and feminist associations, among others.
Civil Society
Djibouti mentions the participation of non-governmental organizations and feminist associations as key stakeholders in the development, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation processes. ","Published in 2017, the timeframe for implementation is 2018 to 2020.","Djibouti’s NAP is structured around three strategic objectives: women's participation in all levels of decision-making for the prevention, management, and regulation of conflicts, prevention of gender-based violence, sexual abuse and exploitation against women and girls, and the protection and security of sexual violence victims during the conflict. 13 specific objectives are also established to improve the protection and promotion of women’s rights during conflicts or post-conflict.","The Action Plan of Djibouti proposes 29 actions to address the strategic and specific objectives. These include amendments to laws and government institutions, studies, sensibilization campaigns, training and workshops, capacity-building measures for public institutions and civil society organizations, etc. Examples of these under the first strategic objective include:
Organize awareness and information campaigns on UNSCR 1325 among the population in general and women in particular.
Increase the participation of Djiboutian women in peacekeeping operations from the UN and the African Union
Increase the number of women trained in mediation and peace negotiation techniques.","Through the NAP, 42 indicators are proposed to review the implementation of the NAP, each of which refers to a proposed action. Examples of the indicators for the actions proposed under the first strategic objective include:
The number of campaigns and number of participants in the UNSCR 1325 awareness and information campaigns.
The number and percentage of women participating in peacekeeping operations
The reports of women’s training workshops in mediation and peace negotiation techniques.
 ","The NAP includes the creation of a coordination, monitoring, and evaluation committee that will be in charge of examining the implementation of the NAP. The responsibilities of the committee include:
Coordinate all the activities considered within the NAP framework by the stakeholders and institutions involved
Regular monitoring of the activities of the NAP
Make the arbitrations for the roles and responsibilities regarding the budget location according to the NAP’s programmation
The committee will work under the direction of the Ministry of Women and Family (MFF), and it will include representatives of institutions and sectors associated with the WPS agenda, all previously listed.
Based on the critical evaluation of the implementation of the NAP until 2020, the Ministry of Women and Family will initiate a new NAP to pursue the outcome of the actions not carried out in the first and to complete them by formulating new ones, carrying the inclusive and participatory mechanism that allowed the development of the NAP.","The full implementation of the NAP requires USD 913,000, including expenses for communication, coordination, monitoring and evaluation, and capacity building for the MFF. The resources will be located according to the specific objectives in the following way
Consideration of women and their interests in decision-making concerning the prevention, management, and resolution of conflicts: USD 65,000

The NAP considers the need for mobilization to ensure the funding for the implementation, which will be through the organization of roundtables with development partners and donors that can choose to support or finance the activity of their preference. ",The Action Plan makes no mention of disarmament.
El Salvador,"El Salvador adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2017 for the period 2017-2022 and its most recent for the period 2022-2024. Analysis is forthcoming. The 2017-2022 NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Salvadoran Institute for the Development of Women, and the Implementation Committee and its Technical Monitoring Committee. These entities were tasked with convening with UN Women, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Spanish Agency for International Development and Cooperation, the Central American Integration System, and the Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy as well as consulting with the Government of Chile. The NAP aims to strengthen women’s participation in all decision-making levels of peace processes; creating a culture of zero-tolerance for violence against women; offering protections and basic services to women and girls; increasing reparations for women and girl victims of armed conflict; and strengthening the monitoring of the implementation of Resolution 1325. The NAP has a detailed implementation matrix that includes actions, indicators, responsible entities, legal frames of reference, and a timeframe. Nevertheless, the NAP does not include an allocated budget. El Salvador reported on the implementation of its NAP and the WPS Agenda in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country provided the following updates, among others (p. 50): The governmental and civil society institutions that make up the National Committee for the Implementation of the National Action Plan have carried out important actions in order to comply with the Plan, among them: Training and sensitization programs on Resolution 1325 have been implemented, directed to the personnel of the Armed Forces of El Salvador, as well as to the personnel who are in the process of Education and Training, to participate in Peacekeeping Operations Missions of the United Nations. Creation of the Network of Women Human Rights Defenders of Women working in the PNC. This is a mechanism to guarantee, defend and promote the rights of women working within the Police Corporation.

Health care for women war veterans and women victims of serious human rights violations. Promotion of psychosocial support groups for women veterans and victims of war. There is a draft document of the Psychosocial Care Manual, which has been consulted with different organizations and experts and is in the process of being formalized. The most recent armed conflict in El Salvador’s history is the civil war, which took place between 1980 and 1992. The country signed a peace agreement known as the Chapultepec Peace Accords in 1992, which outlined a comprehensive reconstruction plan based on widespread reforms. Women constituted 13% of negotiators and 12% of signatories; nevertheless, the peace agreement did not include any provisions on protecting and promoting women’s rights.",1981,80,2014,320M,"NAP Development
The NAP highlights the involvement of the Salvadoran Institute for Women’s Development through the UNSCR1325 Implementation Committee and its Technical Monitoring Committee. The Salvadoran Institute for Women’s Development worked with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to create the NAP, specifically on women’s rights issues.
The NAP notes the role of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the development of the NAP.  The Government of Chile also played an integral role in funding and creating the NAP alongside the Salvadoran Government.  
NAP Implementation
This NAP recognises the partnership of Government entities and civil society throughout the implementation of the NAP. The Salvadoran Institute for Women’s Development will work on implementing the components of the NAP pertaining to the protection of women and girls.
The framework for implementation of the NAP comprises of several parts because of the different pillars.   Different bodies are in charge of the implementation of different objectives.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
Representatives from civil society will form part of the monitoring and evaluation team through the Implementation Committee of Resolution 1325 and its Technical Monitoring Committee.
Government entities will form part of the monitoring and evaluation team through providing reports periodically and ultimately when the NAP ends. For instance, for the pillar pertaining to including women in security issues, the Ministry of Justice and Public Security will be responsible for reporting on their efforts to ensure the increased participation of veteran women in decision making mechanisms.
Timeframe
The implementation period for the National Action Plan of El Salvador is six years (2017-2022).",,"By 2022, the commitments of El Salvador to Women, Peace and Security will be based on the following objectives:

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Salvadoran Institute for the Development of Women  and the  Implementation Committee of Resolution 1325 and its Technical Monitoring Committee are in charge of the oversight of the NAP. These bodies are responsible for formulating, directing, executing and monitoring compliance with the National Policy on Women.
The processes in place for reporting and review are the following:
The activities of the National Implementation Committee, in particular the convening and holding of plenary meetings of the Committee (once a year), meetings of the Board of Directors (twice a year), meetings of the Technical Monitoring Committee (every 2 months) ) and Advisory Group meetings (every 2 months).
Prepare periodic reports that take into account the development and fulfillment of the NAP, in particular the publication of an annual report giving an account of the progress made in its implementation as well as the annual update of the expected indicators.
Monitor the progress of the Institutional commitments and transfer these updates to all the members of the Implementation Committee and, in particular, review and update the contents of the NAP in light of the evolution of national and international standards.
Publish, at the end of this National Action Plan (2017-2022), a report on the level of implementation, challenges and recommendations.",,"There is no total cost of the NAP implementation mentioned in this NAP. The creation of the NAP includes a reference to funding from the Chilean Embassy to El Salvador, UN Women and the Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy.  The implementation of the NAP mentions various government sectors in terms of funding Women, Peace and Security.
There are no indicators or actions included that formulate strategies for sourcing increased funding, detail what level of funding is required for which specific activities, or what accountability mechanisms will ensure funding is raised and used in implementing the NAP.
Disarmament 
The NAP notes the different experiences women and girls face in armed conflict, but fails to  address disarmament issues, or connect the proliferation of weapons with women’s insecurity.",
Estonia,"Estonia approved its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2021 for the period 2020-2025. The NAP is preceded by two others, implemented for the periods 2015-2019 and 2010-2014. Analysis will be published in the near future. The 2015-2019 NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in cooperation with the Ministry of Education and Research, the Ministry of Defense and the Defense Forces, the Defense League, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior, and the Police and Border Guard Board. The NAP identifies civil society inclusion in the development of the NAP, but does not specify which civil society organizations were involved. The NAP approaches the implementation of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda both domestically and internationally, specifically through actions aimed at ensuring women’s human rights through the promotion of gender equality as well as prevention and elimination of gender-based violence. The NAP outlines three main objectives: improve the situation of women in conflict and post-conflict settings, with specific attention to education and increase in opportunities; raise awareness of the impact of conflicts on women as well as of women’s role in ensuring peace and security, particularly through increasing women’s participation in conflict resolution processes; and enhance cooperation and information exchange on WPS implementation at the national and international level. Each objective has corresponding actions and indicators, but the NAP does not have an allocated budget. Estonia’s second is preceded by one other NAP, adopted in 2010 and implemented for the period 2010-2014. The first NAP aimed to implement Resolution 1325 through the following overarching goals: political and diplomatic activities in international organizations; bilateral and multilateral development cooperation and humanitarian assistance; increasing the number of gender experts and trainings for institutions working on peace and security; and increasing the number of women in peacekeeping operations as well as in international positions related to peace and security. While the number of goals has decreased in the second NAP, the content remains consistently similar. Likewise, neither NAP has an allocated budget, while the second NAP indicates that “planned measures will be carried out within the existing budgetary means” (p. 13). Estonia reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Estonia gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Estonia does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but has taken part in overseas military operations, including the Iraq War (2003-2011) and the War in Afghanistan (2001-2014). In 2004, Estonia enacted a Gender Equality Act, which prohibited gender-based discrimination in the public and private sector as well as promoting equal pay among genders. In 2016, Estonia elected its first woman president, Kersti Kaljulaid. In 2019, Estonia established a national human rights institution. In the current moment, Estonia has been experiencing ongoing tension with Russia as a result of the latter’s military activities, including placement of troops and ballistic missiles, in the Baltic Sea Region.",1991,26,2014,656M,"The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in collaboration with representatives from the Ministry of Education and Research, the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of Interior, and the Police and Border Guard Board. Although the NAP indicates participation of the civil society organizations in the development process, none of those organizations are specified.
Implementation
Adopting an outward-facing approach, the NAP focuses on implementing its activities internationally (Page 3) in partnerships with relevant international actors and with a focus on priority partner countries of Estonia’s development cooperation and humanitarian aid, including Afghanistan, Moldova, Ukraine, Georgia and Belarus (Page 6). Government ministries are primarily responsible for the implementation of the NAP, specifically the Ministry of Foregin Affairs and Ministry of Defence. Other offices including the Ministry of Social Affairs, the Ministry of the Environment, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Education and Research are also tasked with the implementation of different activities in cooperation with the Defense League, Women’s Voluntary Defense Organization, and other NGOs, higher education, and research institutions (Pages 7-15). The role of civil society is mostly emphasized in actions aiming at ensuring women’s human rights and capacity building in conflict and post-conflict areas and at raising awareness on the local level regarding the WPS agenda.
Monitoring and Evaluation
The NAP states that the agencies and NGOs that are responsible for implementing the activities will be requested to submit progress reports due in the second halves of 2023 and 2025 for review by the Government of the Republic (Page 15).",The implementation period of the NAP is 2020-2025.,"The NAP has four main objectives: 
Cooperation, exchange of information, and promotion of the objectives of Resolution 1325 at the international level;
Support for women’s human rights and women’s empowerment in conflict and post conflict areas;
Increasing sectoral expertise in the field of women, peace, and security in agencies and raising awareness in Estonia in general;
Increasing the representation of women in positions related to ensuring peace and security in Estonia, including opportunities to participate in international military and civilian operations.
The NAP also aims to focus on emerging global trends in relation to the topic of Women, Peace and Security, namely cybersecurity, climate change and Covid-19 recovery. ",The NAP outlines several sets of activities to address its objectives. Each activity has an indicator and identifies the actors that are responsible for implementation. The activities in the NAP aim at ensuring and supporting women’s human rights through gender mainstreaming in collaboration with relevant international actors and civil society organizations and educational institutions; promotion of accountability for the violations of women’s human rights; and capacity building of relevant actors on addressing gender-based violence.,"An indicator is listed for each action set out under the subset of objectives. For example, under the objective of ensuring women’s human rights and women’s empowerment in conflict and post-conflict areas, the indicator for the activity of “In the framework of multilateral development cooperation and humanitarian aid, making voluntary donations to organizations active in the field of women’s human rights and the improvement of the situation of women and girls and the promotion of gender equality in society in general”   is the “Volume of voluntary contributions and their share of total development cooperation and humanitarian aid” (Page 9).","The implementation of the NAP will be tracked and reports will be written to evaluate progress on the activities. The implementing entities are each required to submit two written overviews of their progress on the activities of the NAP. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will develop a report on the implementation of the NAP, based on the submitted reviews, to the Government of the Republic. ","The NAP does not have an allocated budget, although there is reference to funding for organizations in the field of women's human rights.","The Estonian National Action Plan does not address disarmament issues, or connect the proliferation of weapons with women’s insecurity."
Finland,"Finland adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2023 for the period 2023-2027. The NAP was developed with administrative branches and civil society through workshops, seminars and evaluation of the previous NAP (p. 33). The cross-administrative WPS monitoring group coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs played a key role in preparing the finalized version of the NAP, and the NAP states that the expertise of NGOs and civil society was tapped across a broad front (p.33). The implementation of the NAP will be primarily coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Education and Culture, the Ministry of Defence, the Defence Forces, the Ministry of the Interior and the Crisis Management Centre (CMC Finland), which operates in conjunction with the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Ministry of Environment. NGOs that have committed to implementing the NAP include Finn Church Aid, the Rule of Law Centre, the Finnish Refugee Council, the Finnish Red Cross, and the Family Federation of Finland. Finland’s NAP approaches the implementation of the WPS Agenda both domestically and internationally, and identifies five thematic objectives: conflict prevention and peacebuilding; peace processes and peace mediation; security sector, crisis management, and crisis preparedness; safety of women and girls and realization of their rights in conflicts; and mainstreaming and advocacy (p28). The NAP also outlines principles that underscore the country’s approach to lasting peace, conflict prevention and crisis management, including: human rights-based planning; the concept of comprehensive security (e.g. impacts of climate change, health threats, human rights violations, migration, economic crises, inequalities as well as recognising that peace is not just the absence of violent conflict, but an equal and democratic society underpinned by human rights and human security); a gender transformative approach; and intersectionality (p.24). The NAP does not include monitoring and implementation indicators. Instead, it states that a separate implementation plan will be drawn up by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and indicators will be created to underpin the monitoring of the plan (p.73). Despite an evaluation report of Finland’s third NAP stating that the greatest challenges in implementation were associated with undersized personnel and budgetary resources, no clear budget is mentioned in the fourth NAP (p.23). The three former NAPs were adopted in 2008, 2012 and 2018, for the periods 2008-2011, 2012-2016, and 2018-2021 respectively. The structure and level of detail across Finland’s NAPs remains similar, with each NAP focusing on conflict prevention, peace processes and peacebuilding and crisis management, with the safety and human rights of women and girls appearing as an overarching objective across them all. Additionally, the fourth NAP continues the work of the third NAP in terms of addressing disarmament with a specific outcome focused on incorporating gender perspectives into arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation (p.38). The fourth NAP, however, also has an additional section relating to mainstreaming of the WPS agenda, and the advocacy work that Finland aims to do at the country and international level (p.69). Finland does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but experiences ongoing political tension because of the military exercises conducted by Russia in the Baltic Sea Region. Additionally, about six months prior to the publication of the fourth NAP, Finland formally joined NATO , which is a major policy shift away from non-alignment. Domestically and regionally, Finland works on the WPS agenda through diplomacy, crisis management, development cooperation, humanitarian aid and other expert work and training with EU policy measures. Internationally, Finland has collaborated with the governments of Afghanistan, Kenya and Nepal to support their efforts in the implementation and follow-up of their WPS NAPs. Finland is also a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies, a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for GBV in humanitarian emergencies.",1986,3,2014,4.82B,"NAP Development  
The NAP was developed with administrative branches and civil society through workshops, seminars and evaluation of the previous NAP (p. 33). The cross-administrative WPS monitoring group coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs played a key role in preparing the finalized version of the NAP, and the NAP states that the expertise of NGOs and civil society was tapped across a broad front (p.33) 
NAP Implementation  
The implementation of the NAP will be primarily coordinated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Education and Culture, the Ministry of Defence, the Defence Forces, the Ministry of the Interior and the Crisis Management Centre (CMC Finland), which operates in conjunction with the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Ministry of Environment. NGOs that have committed to implementing the NAP include Finn Church Aid, the Rule of Law Centre, the Finnish Refugee Council, the Finnish Red Cross, and the Family Federation of Finland.  
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation  
There is no specific information about the actors involved in the monitoring and evaluation of the NAP. The NAP states that a separate implementation plan and measures will be drawn up under the coordination of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ensure efficient implementation (p.73). It also states that the “implementing parties” will participate in the preparation of this plan, establishing their areas of responsibility and updating it when necessary (p.73).  
WILPF 
WILPF Finland was founded in 1926 by Maikki Friberg, the long-time president of the Union of Women’s Affairs and the group is the oldest women’s peace organization in Finland. WILPF Finland is part of various initiatives at the national level, including against Finnish membership of NATO. The section also works to raise awareness about UNSCR 1325.  ",The implementation period for Finland’s fourth NAP is 2023-2027.,"Finland’s fourth NAP identifies five overarching objectives:  
Conflict prevention and peacebuilding 
Involving actions that promote gender equality including enabling women's economic and political empowerment, supporting women’s and girls’ education, and promoting their sexual and reproductive health and rights (p.27) 
Peace processes and peace mediation 
Involving actions that promote women’s status and their involvement in peace mediation, dialogue and peace processes (p.27) 
Security sector, crisis management and crisis preparedness 
Aims to reinforce the WPS agenda within the military and civilian crisis management. Looks at the defense sector and NATO membership as boosts to the implementation of the WPS agenda (p.27) 
Safety of women and girls and realization of their rights in conflicts 
Aims to reduce violence against women and girls, women’s access to legal protection as well as legal responsibility. Also includes the protection of human rights defenders and women’s role in humanitarian assistance activities  
Mainstreaming and advocacy 
To continue efforts to intensify the WPS agenda at normative level and raise awareness of it, in particular within international organizations - UN, OSCE, EU, AU and NATO ","Strategic outcomes are listed at the end of each objective’s ‘chapter’, which includes various results and sub-results to achieve the overall objectives. Examples include:  
Objective 1: Meaningful participation of women in all their diversity is strengthened in conflict prevention  
Women’s social, economic and political status improves 
Finland dismantles discriminatory social norms and gender stereotypes as part of peacebuilding  
Finland promotes equality and non-discrimination in peacebuilding at the national level  
Gender perspective is integrated into arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation at national and international levels  
Finland promotes and supports the meaningful participation of women in policy discussions and negotiations on arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation  
Objective 4: The safety and rights of women and girls are better safeguarded and their diverse needs are better met during crises  
Gender perspective and the participation of women in all their diversity in humanitarian assistance work is promoted  
In humanitarian fora, Finland emphasizes the special needs of women and girls in vulnerable situations (including women with disabilities, sexual and gender minorities, older women) and promotes the accessibility of humanitarian assistance  ","There are no specific indicators mentioned in the NAP. The NAP states that within the separate implementation plan, guidelines will be developed to support reporting, and indicators will be created to underpin the monitoring of the NAP (p.73).  ","There is no specific section about monitoring and evaluation in the NAP. However, it states that the responsibility for monitoring rests with “responsible parties” in the central government and that civil society actors will bring important added value to the monitoring of the NAP (p.73). The NAP also adds that progress will be followed up by a national monitoring group led by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, noting that representatives of the parties responsible for implementing the NAP, including ministries and NGOs as well as the Finnish National Women, Peace and Security Network, will be invited to participate in the monitoring group.  ",There is no specific budget mentioned in the NAP despite an evaluation report of Finland’s third NAP stating that the greatest challenges in implementation were associated with undersized personnel and budgetary resources (p.23).,"Finland’s NAP addresses disarmament with a specific outcome focused on incorporating gender perspectives into arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation (p.38).  "
France,"France’s current National Action Plan on WPS has the implementation period 2021 to 2025. It is preceded by two others. France structured its third nap around the thematic pillars of prevention, protection (including the fight against impunity), participation and promotion of the agenda. It states that the NAP is aligned with its international strategy for gender equality (2018-2022), the EU’s Women, Peace and Security regional action plan for 2019-2024, and the European Union gender action plan (GAP III). France’s commitment to implementing the women, peace and security agenda is aligned with its feminist diplomacy policy, which concerns its external actions and is based on France’s international strategy on gender equality. France does not have a history of recent armed conflict, but contributes to overseas military operations and peacekeeping missions as well as having been involved in interventions in insurgencies and conflicts in the Central African Republic, the Maghreb, and Mali. In 2019, France was among the top 10 military spenders as well as being among top 5 arms exporters in the world. France is also a contributor to humanitarian aid, including being a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies , a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. At the multilateral level, France is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, holding veto power on all Council decisions, and possesses nuclear weapons.",1983,15,2014,50B,"In the process of implementing the last two NAPs and developing the current one, France assigned the Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs; the Ministry of Armed Forces; the Ministry of Culture; the Ministry of the Interior; the Ministry of Justice; the Ministry for National Education, Youth and Sport; the Ministry for Higher Education, Research and Innovation; the Ministry for Gender Equality, Diversity and Equal opportunities; the Agence Française Développement; and the French office for the protection of refugees and stateless persons. The Ministry for Solidarity and Health was also consulted to provide its expertise on sexual and reproductive rights and health. The national consultative Commission on Human Rights, the High Council for Gender Equality, and civil society were consulted for drafting and will participate in implementation. ",The timeframe of the NAP is 2021-2025.,"Strengthen and develop the available training specifically on the inclusion of gender and the protection of women against sexual violence and violent extremisms in conflict and post-conflict situations. Every stakeholder concerned by this plan will be responsible for providing  training to all the staff in charge of the implementation, especially law enforcement and the judiciary, and in particular the personas in charge of welcoming and guiding survivors of violence in France and abroad. 
Continue to develop teaching tools for including gender and protection against sexual violence and violent extremisms in conflict and post-conflict situations (information sheets, models, regular seminars presenting agenda topics).
Continue education policies on prevention and fighting gender inequalities and sexist and sexual violence, which help train future citizens, renew community education and youth initiatives, and develop actions in the fields of informal and non-formal education. 
Strengthen French programmes dedicated to gender challenges in conflict and post-conflict humanitarian contexts, especially in coordination with civil society in countries where these programmes are applied, increase the specific support that must be provided for women and girls who are survivors of violence, including sexual violence; include the OECD “gender” marker in bilateral humanitarian projects, as France committed to in tis humanitarian strategy for 2018-2022 and continue to advocate for its incorporation by the UN and European Agencies, funds and programmes. 
Strengthen support to the documentation, collection and analysis of sex-disaggregated data and investigations into sexual violence.",,,"The NAP states that civil society will be closely involved in monitoring implementation. To this end, a regular dialogue will be institutionalized with French civil society and that of the priority countries for all challenges linked to the implementation of the Women, Peace and Security Agenda. The implementation will be evaluated by the High Council for Gender Equality and the National Consultative Commission on Human Rights. A report of the plan will be presented to the National Assembly and the Senate.",The NAP references financing and budget in relation to the successful implementation of different activities of the NAP.,
Gabon,,1983,,,271.5M,"NAP Development
The development stages of the NAP took place over the period of 2015-2020, headed by the Ministry for the Promotion and Integration of Women in Development, with inputs from actors in public institutions and communities, civil society, media and technical and financial partners.  Actors in civil society and the security sector, traditional chiefs, and partners were also participants in general consultations (p. 11).  The key steps for NAP development outlined in the guide for the implementation of UNSCR 1325 published by West African Network for Peacebuilding (WANEP) were followed.
NAP Implementation
The Ministry for the Promotion and Integration of Women in Development is responsible for coordination, including formalizing governmental bodies such the Interministerial Committee on WPS, defining the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders, and mechanisms for the involvement and participation of representatives of ministries, parliament, civil society organizations (CSOs), the private sector, political parties, governmental programmes, the UN system and technical & financial partners (p. 16).
Implementation will be based on a system that collects, analyzes and distributes data in close coordination with the Director General of Statistics (p. 22).  At the institutional level, it will involve the creation of a set of procedures to allow communication between different actors at the central, provincial, municipal and local levels.  These actors fall under the groups including parliament, magistrate/judicial institutions, ministries, central and local administration institutions, political parties, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), CSOs, the academic and scientific community, media/press, communities and families, and international partners (p. 16).  
NAP monitoring and evaluation
The National Monitoring Committee will meet, under the direction of the supervising ministry, in order to share achievements, evaluate progress and challenges, and formulate recommendations.  The data collected by the WPS focal points of different institutions will contribute to an annual national report, under the coordination of the supervising ministry.  Civil society will also carry out a mid-term independent evaluation.  The four year operational plan for the NAP will be updated in light of the results, challenges raised and recommendations formulated by this reporting (p. 22).  
Civil Society
Gabon’s NAP states that it recognizes the essential role that CSOs play in the advancement and implementation of the WPS Agenda, essential service provision, and providing crucial support for women in post-conflict contests.  A continuous dialogue maintained in a framework of exchange and learning called called «Communauté de pratiques» (‘Community of Practice’) will help to institutionalize the participation of CSOs and women’s groups in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the NAP and the WPS Agenda.  A network of organizations and movements defending the rights of women in different areas of the country will be consolidated in order to implement innovative actions on WPS (p. 23).",The NAP will be implemented for the period 2020-2023.,"There are two overarching objectives that Gabon’s NAP aims to address: firstly, increasing the participation of women in decision-making processes and their full participation in all peace and security efforts; secondly, eradicating women’s human rights violations including sexual violence against women and girls and the trafficking of women and children (p. 13).
The NAP focuses on six priorities, called axes (p. 3 and p. 13):
Prevention, management and transformation of conflicts at the national and sub-regional levels, and the fight against gender-based violence.
The protection and respect for the human rights of women and girls, and taking into account issues related to gender equality in politics and programmes of relief and recovery in conflict and post-conflict situations 
The equal participations and representation of women in decision-making institutions and peacebuilding mechanisms at the national, sub-regional, regional and international levels
Women, girls and the management of the environment and climate change
The economic empowerment and inclusion of women 
The coordination, promotion and implementation of UNSCR 1325, mobilization of resources, sustainable partnerships, and monitoring & evaluation of the NAP.
The NAP focuses on these axes through six objectives (p. 13-14)
The prevention, management and transformation of conflicts at the national and sub-regional levels, and the integration of gender mainstreaming in all conflict prevention strategies and activities, the creation of mechanisms and institutions which take into account the needs of women and redoubling efforts to prevent violence against women, in particular diverse forms of sexual violence.
Assure the protection and defence of the human rights of women and girls, taking into account issues of gender equality, increasing efforts on matters of protection and physical & mental health, as well as the dignity of women and girls, and integrating gender mainstreaming in legal and institutional reforms.
a) Promote and support the active and meaningful participation of women in all peace processes as well as their equal representation in official and informal decision-making bodies, and peacebuilding mechanisms at the national, sub-regional, regional and international levels; b) Improve the work in partnership and in network with associations and organizations defending the rights of women at the local, national, sub-regional and international levels, and to support the appointment of women in key positions in the military and civilian defence and law enforcement forces.
Promote the concepts of gender and climate involving women and girls, and in reinforcing their resilience and capacity for adaptation in the face of climate hazards, natural risks and catastrophes, and climate management.
Reinforce the efforts for women’s economic security, increase the production potential, and significantly increase the economic and social development of the country, and women’s emancipation through their empowerment and economic inclusion.
Ensure the coordination, promotion of ownership and implementation of resolution 1325, mobilization of resources, establishment of strategic, sustainable partnerships and the monitoring & evaluation of a NAP and associated programmes and projects. ","In Gabon’s NAP, a logistical framework allocates each of the six axes a set of products.  Under the operational framework, each of those products are assigned a subset of actions, each with an associated responsible body and timeframe. 
For example, under axis 2 of ""protection and respect for the human rights of women and girls, and taking into account issues related to gender equality in politics and programmes of relief and recovery in conflict and post-conflict situations"", there are four products such as (p. 42): 
Project 2.2 ""Joint projects on the integration of Resolution 1325 in programmes fighting against national and regional threats to peace are realized (terrorism, violent extremism, martime piracy, transnational crime, small arms and light weapons"". This project has actions including: Implement regional projects on planning and budgeting methods according to gender; and Initiate studies and publish regular reports with gender disaggregated data on all sectors. 
The 2020 Roadmap, which outlines actions and priorities for the first year of implementation, contains eleven axes of intervention and forty-eight priority actions (p. 16), each action with an associated responsible body, budget and timeframe.  For example, under Axis 7 ""Reinforce the capacities of stakeholder parties"" (p. 72) there are seven associated actions, such as:
Organize a training workshop on project identification and formulation, and the development of a resource mobilization strategy. Responsible bodies: the Ministry in charge of the Promotion of Women and other stakeholder parties. Timeframe: June 2020.","Each product in the logistical framework and each action in the operational framework of Gabon’s NAP is given a set of indicators, as well as sources of verification.  
For example, under axis 4, action 4.2.1 ""Contribute to the development of a strategy for emissions reduction related to deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) in connection with the benefits of adaptation taking gender-sensitivity into account in the forestry sector"" includes the indicator: ""The existence of a emissions reduction strategy related to deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+)""","The logistical framework of Gabon’s NAP contains not only indicators but also includes hypotheses and risks predicted for each product (p. 28-27).  A toolbox, including a framework of risk mitigation, will be developed.  The National Monitoring Committee will meet, under the direction of the supervising ministry, in order to share achievements, evaluate progress and challenges, and formulate recommendations.  Other platforms for these activities will be developed as necessary over the course of implementation.  The data collected by the WPS Focal Points of different institutions will contribute to an annual national report, under the coordination of the supervising ministry.  Civil society will also carry out a mid-term independent evaluation.  The four year operational plan for the NAP will be updated based on the results, challenges raised and recommendations formulated in this report (p. 22-23).  ","The total amount budgeted to Gabon’s NAP is 3,033,950 000 F.CFA (Central African CFA Franc) or $5,056,583 USD, across the six national priorities.  Priority 1 is budgeted the most at 1,187,500,000 F.CFA ($1,979,167 USD), and Priority 5 budgeted the least at 116,500,000 F.CFA ($194,167 USD).  The 2020 Roadmap is budgeted 527,000,000 F.CFA ($876,334 USD) across its eleven axes of intervention, bringing the total budget to 3,560,950,000 F.CFA ($5,932,917 USD) (p. 17-20).
Each action in both the NAP Axis and 2020 Roadmap are allocated a cost, with the former having an allocation for each of the four years of implementation.","Disarmament is discussed in axis 1, which focuses on conflict prevention.  Action 1.2.3 makes direct references to disarmament and small arms and light weapons (SALW): Develop and implement disarmament plans, and fight against the proliferation of SALW.  Product 2.2 also identifies SALW among the threats to national and regional peace.
The NAP also identities women in post-conflict and relief & recovery projects, with specific references to disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR).  For example Product 2.4 makes specific references to women’s specific needs and interests in post-conflict projects such as DDR, as well as post-conflict justice, and repatriation, rehabilitation and reintegration of victims of armed conflict (p. 30), with its Action 2.4.2 making direct reference to the capacities of women in matters of security sector reform, DDR, the fight against SALW, and reconciliation (p. 43)."
Gambia,"The Gambia adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2012, but the NAP does not identify a specific period of implementation. The development of the NAP involved reviewing existing literature on UNSCR 1325, the Gambia’s National Gender and Women’s Empowerment Policy 2010-2020, other laws, conventions, bills and policies that affect the rights of women and girls internationally and nationally. The NAP has three overarching goals: to ensure greater respect for women’s right to participation in the decision-making processes on equal footing with men; to eliminate discrimination against women and to end SGBV perpetrated against women; and to involve women in the security sector, conflict resolution mechanisms and peace processes, including peacekeeping operations. Each goal has corresponding actions, outputs, and indicators as well as an allocated budget. Gambia reported on the implementation of its NAP in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country indicated the development of a second NAP, which will have the following priorities (p. 27): Sensitization on and popularization of women’s human rights and promotion of peace, including UNSCR 1325 and related resolutions targeting decision makers; various sectors; women and men at all levels; educational and academic institutions as well as opinion, religious and traditional leaders, and other stakeholders to appreciate gender equality and to know what provisions are available; Capacity strengthening of partner organisations on gender, women, peace and security to systematically build the foundation of the ripple down effect need to reach a broader constituency of the population and to enhance strategic partnerships; Strengthening the early warning mechanism to avoid internal conflict; Implement the recommendations of research directed at enhancing participation and representation of women; Exchange visits with neighbouring countries to enhance partnerships, learning and sharing on good practices. The Gambia gained independence in 1965 from the United Kingdom, after decades of colonial rule under the British empire. In 1981, Gambia experienced a failed coup attempt, while another coup attempt in 1994 led to the overthrow of the government and subsequent military rule until 1996. Political instability in the country continued throughout the 2000s, with failed coup attempts in 2000, 2006, and 2014. The country underwent a state of emergency following its 2016 elections, with the refusal of the then president Yahya Jammeh to concede power, and returned to normalcy after international intervention, specifically through the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). Women were disproportionately impacted by the 22-year rule under president Yahya Jammeh, which was marked by widespread human rights violations. Specifically, women human rights defenders were threatened for any possible critique of the government, while women and girls were deliberately targeted with sexual and gender-based violence.",1993,136,,14.1M,"NAP Development
WILPF does not have a country section in Gambia and therefore was not involved in the development process of Gambia's NAP.
This National Action Plan was developed in different phases. The first phase consisted of consultations and discussions, which were carried out with major stakeholders both at policy level and operational levels. The action plan was then validated at a meeting attended by government institutions and civil society organizations dealing directly or indirectly with women, peace and security issues.
NAP Implementation
Civil Society is tasked with partial ownership of certain objectives and activities without specifying which organizations are responsible for what. The GOTG has created a conducive atmosphere within which CSOs working on women, peace and security have effectively operated by putting in place the necessary legislations. These organizations include a local Office of WANEP for advocacy and monitoring with a view to reducing the proliferation of Small Arms in West Africa. Organizations such as the Female Lawyers Association of The Gambia and GAMCOTRAP offer legal counseling and other services to women on a variety of matters relating to their statutory rights, gender violence, family maintenance and child custody.
For instance, under Pillar 1 Participation, Strategic Issue 1. ""Developing national programmes that promote peace and women’s rights"", CSOs are tasked with the ownership of ""sensitising decisionmakers and opinion leaders and stakeholders to appreciate women’s rights generally and gender-equality"" together with the Ministry of Women's Affairs and Women's Bureau.
The implementation of the NAP is the responsibility of all the Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) of the GOTG. However, the primary driver of the action rests with the OVP/MOWA and its implementation arm, the Women’s Bureau.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
Civil Society is said to be part of a national steering committee or an observatory through which coordination, partnerships, and strategic linkages will not only be further cemented for all stakeholders including civil society organization, private sector, UN Agencies and donors, but also reporting guidelines will be developed and mechanisms adopted to evaluate and measure the results and impact of the action plan.
The NAP states that a national steering committee or an observatory will be created through which coordination, partnerships, and strategic linkages will be further cemented for all stakeholders including civil society organization, private sector, UN Agencies and donors.",There is no mention on the implementation period for the Gambia National Action Plan.,"The main goals of The Gambia NAP are:
To ensure greater respect for women’s right to participation in the decision-making processes on equal footing with men.
To eliminate discrimination against women and to end SGBV perpetrated against women.
To involve women in the security sector, conflict resolution mechanisms and peace processes, including peacekeeping operations.",,"Each pillar has a key area focus within its strategic issue. Each strategic issue has both the output and the indicator. For instance, in Pillar 3 “Participation”, Strategic issue 1 “1. Adopting affirmative measures that will ensure equitable representation and participation of women at all decision-making levels” has the following key focus area, “1.1. Develop a national framework (laws, policies etc.) that will increase the number of women appointed to all decisionmaking levels”, which indicator is the number of mechanisms created.","The implementation of the GNAP is the responsibility of all the Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) of the GOTG. However, the primary driver of the action rests with the OVP/MOWA and its implementation arm, Women’s Bureau. It is envisaged that a national steering committee or an observatory will be created through which coordination, partnerships, and strategic linkages will not only be further cemented for all stakeholders including civil society organization, private sector, UN Agencies and donors, but also reporting guidelines will be developed and mechanisms adopted to evaluate and measure the results and impact of the action plan.","The Gambia National Action Plan includes an allocated budget for each strategic issue in the key area focus for each pillar. However, there is no mention on actions that formulate fundraising strategies, or what accountability mechanisms will ensure funding is raised and used in implementing the NAP.","The GNAP references implementing all measures related to women, peace, and security which includes the ECOWAS Convention on Small Arms and Light Weapons and Their Ammunition and Other Related Materials.  They also briefly address the need to support civil society to stop the proliferation of small arms in Africa but do not note any specific actions to be taken."
Georgia,"The 2022-2023 NAP was developed by the Inter-Agency Commission on Gender Equality, Violence Against Women and Domestic Violence (hereinafter the Commission), with UN Women technical support within the framework of the project “Accelerating Implementation of the Women, Peace and Security Agenda in Georgia”, which was funded by the U.K. Government’s Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF) (p.6). The process of drafting the NAP was coordinated by the Human Rights Secretariat of the Government of Georgia, with representatives of local and international non-governmental organizations, relevant experts, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders taking part in working meetings and consultations (p.6). The NAP interprets the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda primarily in a domestic sense, with a heavy focus on conflict-affected areas, internally displaced persons, and occupied territories within Georgia. That said, the NAP includes plans on mainstreaming the WPS agenda in international diplomatic activities as well. The NAP has three impact areas: women’s participation; elimination and prevention of violence; and women’s empowerment and protection. These thematic priority areas identify corresponding actions and indicators, including baseline and target indicators, and the organization or government department responsible for verifying and collecting data. The monitoring and evaluation framework for the NAP is broad and includes the Commission providing periodic reports, the Human Rights Secretariat engaging with stakeholders and providing recommendations for amendments if need be, and six-monthly progress reports throughout the timeframe of the NAP (p. 18-19). The NAP has an allocated budget of GEL 27,680,907 (roughly USD $10,426,877) (p.18.). The NAP also lays out the budget for some specific activities, including amount and source of funding. Georgia’s fourth NAP is preceded by three other NAPs, implemented for the period of 2012-2015, 2016-2017, and 2018-2020, respectively. Georgia’s first NAP forms part of broader national efforts to mainstream gender and was developed following the adoption of the Law on Gender Equality in 2010, and the establishment of the Council for Gender Equality. Working at the national level to the grassroots level and in cooperation with international donors and UN agencies, the NAP says that women’s organizations have been instrumental in the development and implementation of the NAP in Georgia. The country’s four NAPs are similar in structure and level of detail. Each NAP is primarily an implementation matrix that includes goals, outputs, indicators, responsible party, and timeline. The second and third NAPs also include a preface that provides a brief overview of the implementation of previous NAPs as well as participatory drafting processes of NAPs. The fourth NAP expands on former iterations and includes a ‘situation analysis’ that outlines and identifies existing challenges relating to the protection of women’s social and economic rights and their meaningful participation in peace and security processes (p.7). Georgia gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Since then, the country has experienced multiple periods of conflict, including the Abkhazia War (1992-1993) and the Russo-Georgian War (2008). Despite the fact that women have been mostly excluded from peace processes involving these conflicts, women-led groups and CSOs have continued to work with women impacted directly by the violence, including internally displaced women and girls. They have also consistently advocated for their inclusion in peacebuilding initiatives.",1994,76,2014,360M,"NAP Development 
The Georgia NAP was developed by the Commission with technical support from UN Women and funding from the UK Government’s Conflict, Stability, and Security Fund (p.2). The Human Rights Secretariat of the Government of Georgia and the Advisor to the Prime Minister of Human Rights were also involved in the development of the NAP (p.6). Representatives of local and international non-governmental organisations, civil society organisations, relevant experts, and other stakeholders collaborated with these government departments through working meetings and discussions (p.6).
NAP Implementation 
The Commission is the main body responsible for the implementation of the NAP. It ensures NAP implementation through the Human Rights Secretariat of the Administration of the Government of Georgia (p.18). The Human Rights Secretariat provides supplemental support in implementation by engaging stakeholders throughout the implementation process (p.18). Additionally, for each output indicator listed in the NAP, a ‘responsible agency’ has been designated to be in charge of implementation, alongside a partner agency if relevant. These include the following: The Office of the State Minister of Georgia for Reconciliation and Civic Equality; Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Georgia; Ministry of Internally Displaced Person from the Occupied Territories, Labour, Health and Social Affairs of Georgia; Government of the Autonomous Republic of Abkhazia; Administration of South Ossetia; Embassy of Germany in Georgia; Embassy of Switzerland in Georgia; Embassy of the United Kingdom in Georgia; UN Women; Civil society organizations; Legal Aid Service.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation 
The Commission and the Human Rights Secretariat are responsible for monitoring and evaluation of the NAP. Information on the implementation of NAP activities will be processed in the form of progress and annual reports, to be submitted every six months during the NAP time frame (p.19). The first of these will be an Annual report after the first year, followed by a Progress report after an additional 6 months, followed by the next Annual report etc. ",The NAP implementation period is three years (2022-2024).,"The 2022-2024 NAP identifies three impact areas that set the vision for Georgia’s WPS implementation strategy. These areas have been selected for their contributions to the four pillars of WPS, and their relevance across Georgia’s broader foreign, development, defense and security policies. They include: 
(1) Women’s Participation: increasing representation and meaningful participation of women (including at decision-making level) in peace and security processes
(2) Elimination and Prevention of Violence: promoting the elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls (including sexual violence, gender-based violence and risks related to human security)
(3) Women’s Empowerment and Protection: improving access to public services and the socioeconomic empowerment of women and girls affected by conflict (including IDPs and those living adjacent to the occupied territories)","Strategic outcomes have a comprehensive set of actions assigned. These are outlined in Annex A of the NAP (p. 38-47). It goes through all five strategic objectives, and lists the priority, the commitment, and the organizational lead for the action.","Each activity has a set of indicators attached. For example, for Goal 1, “promoting the elimination and prevention of all forms of violence against women and girls (including sexual violence, gender-based violence and risks related to human security)” the following indicators are listed: 
Share of conflict-affected women and girls (including IDPs and those living adjacent to the occupied territories) with an increased level of awareness on human security issues 
Share of security and justice sector personnel trained on the issues of preventing and responding to sexual and gender-based violence 
Share of trained gender advisers and military personnel (including military personnel participating in peacekeeping missions)
Each indicator is listed with a baseline statistic, meaning as of 2021, alongside the target 2024 statistic. A ‘source of verification’ is also indicated i.e. the ministry/government department responsible for reporting the indicator.","The NAP will undergo regular evaluations in the form of monitoring reports. These will use the updated information on the implementation of NAP activities and will be submitted every six months during the timeframe of the NAP. All annual reports will be published on the official website of the Human Rights Secretariat in order to inform decision makers and stakeholders about the progress of the implementation of the NAP. Upon the completion of the NAP, a systemic evaluation will be carried out to determine the NAP’s impact and ensure accountability.","The budget for the NAP totals GEL 27,680,907 (roughly USD $10,426,877).","Georgia’s NAP does not address disarmament issues, or connect the proliferation of weapons with women’s insecurity."
Germany,"Germany adopted its third National Action Plan (NAP) for the period 2021-2024. This NAP builds on the work of the previous two plans, implemented for the periods 2017-2020 and 2013-2016. It was developed by the Interministerial Working Group for Women, Peace and Security. Its six priority areas are c risis prevention; p articipation; p rotection and support; h umanitarian assistance, crisis management, and reconstruction; s trengthening the Women, Peace and Security Agenda; and i ncreasing institutional integration and capacities. Compared to the previous two NAPs, it contains an expanded monitoring and evaluation framework (page 42 onwards) which provides details on the implementation of activities. Although some indicators in the NAP indicate the allocation of financial resources, other budgetary details are not provided in the NAP. The previous NAP was adopted in 2017 for the period 2017-2020. The second NAP identified five focal points towards the implementation of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda, including gender-sensitive conflict prevention; women’s increased participation in conflict prevention and peacebuilding; increased attention to the needs of women and girls in humanitarian action; protection from sexual and gender-based violence; and promoting the WPS agenda at the national, regional, and international level. While each focal point had corresponding goals, the NAP did not identify specific indicators, a monitoring and evaluation framework, or an allocated budget. The first German NAP, implemented for 2013-2016, compiled its objectives under six thematic goals: prevention; preparation of operations, basic, advanced, and continued training; participation; protection; reintegration and reconstruction; and criminal prosecution. The NAP interpreted the implementation of the WPS agenda mostly internationally. In the first NAP, disarmament was approached through the framework of disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration efforts (DDR). However, the second NAP expanded this focus by identifying incorporating a gender perspective into arms control projects as one of its objectives. The third NAP addresses disarmament within the context of conflict/crisis prevention and protection. Germany reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Germany does not have a recent history of internal armed conflict, but contributes to overseas military operations and peacekeeping missions. In 2019, Germany was among the top 10 military spenders as well as being among top 5 arms exporters in the world. Germany is also a contributor to humanitarian aid, including being a contributing donor to the Women’s Peace and Humanitarian Fund , a global partnership that works to empower women in conflict zones and humanitarian crises. Germany is also a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies , a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. At the multilateral level, Germany was most recently a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2019-2020.",1985,10,2014,49B,"Development
The German Government’s Third Action Plan for Women, Peace and Security is a document issued by the Interministerial Working Group for Women, Peace and Security (IMAG). The six ministries in this working group are the Federal Foreign Office (FFO); the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women, and Youth (BMFSFJ); the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building, and Community (BMI); the Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection (BMJV); the Federal Ministry of Defence (BMVg); and the Federal Ministry for Economic Co-operation and Development (BMZ). The NAP identifies that it builds on implementation report conclusions from previous NAPs as well as consultations with civil society both in Germany and abroad (including in conflict and post-conflict areas) and thematic experts (pg.11).
Implementation
According to the NAP (pg. 41), the “entire German Government is tasked with preparing and implementing the Action Plan”. At the half-way stage of the NAP (approximately the end of 2022/early 2023), there will be an interactive exchange with civil society.
M&E
The ministries responsible for monitoring and evaluation of the NAP are the Federal Foreign Office (FFO/AA); the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women, and Youth (BMFSFJ); the Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building, and Community (BMI); the Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer Protection (BMJV); the Federal Ministry of Defence (BMVg); and the Federal Ministry for Economic Co-operation and Development (BMZ). There is a detailed monitoring and evaluation plan in the NAP (pg. 42 onwards).
WILPF
WILPF Germany continues to be actively engaged in advocacy for implementation of the Women, Peace and Security agenda in Germany. As part of Network 1325, WILPF Germany contributed to a policy briefing to inform the process of the NAP development. This policy briefing was cited on page 11 of the NAP, and focused on the implementation of the agenda. This policy briefing contained numerous recommendations for the NAP in its third iteration, including:
Employing gender-sensitive conflict analysis;
Ensuring that at least 85% of German development aid from 2021 onwards directly or indirectly contributes to gender equality;
Fully realizing reproductive rights within Germany, including by eliminating Sections 218 and 219 of the German criminal code;
Substantively including women and girls who are refugees in the formulation of policy;
Working towards a complete cessation of arms exports.",The timeframe for this NAP is 2021-2024.,"The six priority areas of the NAP are:
Crisis prevention
Participation
Protection and support
Humanitarian assistance, crisis management, and reconstruction
Strengthening the Women, Peace and Security Agenda
Increasing institutional integration and capacities
These priority areas aim to cover all areas of the WPS agenda as well as strengthening the agenda and capacities for implementation. Additionally, the NAP aligns itself with foreign and some domestic policy in Germany.
Furthermore, the NAP adopts several principles that inform the implementation of the activities:
Exploring the causes of gender inequality (pg. 15)
WPS as a horizontal policy in work for the German peace and security strategy, development cooperation, and humanitarian assistance (pg. 16)",,"One or more indicators have been assigned to each target of the NAP. Some are qualitative and others are quantitative, and certain indicators have been derived from previous indicators in order to support consistent WPS implementation. 
Two examples of indicators are: “Number and description of programmes, projects and initiatives which explore WPS-related ramifications of climate change, and of desertification, droughts and other results of climate change” and “Number of women human rights defenders and women peacebuilders who have been supported by the Elisabeth Selbert Initiative”.
 ","The NAP features a detailed Monitoring and Evaluation Plan (pg. 42 onwards). Data will be collected on an ongoing basis, with responsibility in each ministry. There will also be an interactive exchange with civil society halfway through the NAP implementation to assess progress.
There are three implementation periods that have been identified: short-term measures by the end of 2021; medium-term measures to be implemented by the end of 2022, and long-term measures for prioritising WPS work","A specific budget is not detailed in the NAP, although the NAP includes indicators related to financing specific projects and initiatives.","Under the NAP objective of crisis prevention, there is a target related to gender and disarmament. This target is: “Gender-based analyses are taken into account in controls of small arms and light firearms, in disarmament, and in arms controls and export controls. Participation by women in decision-making processes is also strengthened at all levels.”
The following measures related to disarmament are outlined under this target:
Reducing the illegal distribution and trade in small arms and light firearms on the basis of gender-based analyses and data collection. 
Increasing participation by women in national, regional and international processes for disarmament, arms control and arms export control; developing capacity through training and continuing professional development projects, in addition to establishing networks, in particular by promoting the global Gender Equality Network for Small Arms Control (GENSAC). 
Including the goals of the Women, Peace and Security agenda as a permanent part of the concluding documents for arms controls and arms export controls in international forums; collecting gender-based data on the use of certain weapons in specific countries and regions. 
As part of the risk analysis of potential human rights violations for arms export controls, an assessment is also made of the risk as to whether grievous acts of sexual and gender-based violence or serious violence against women and girls could be perpetrated using the requested military equipment (Arms Trade Treaty, Article 7(4)).
Additionally, under the goal of protection, the NAP draws the link between sexual and gender-based violence and arms: “Sexual and gender-based violence is also associated with a growing social propensity to violence, militarisation, the proliferation of small arms and light firearms, fight and displacement, the collapse of the rule of law and the proximity of armed people to the civilian population. In the context of armed conflict, acts of sexual and gender-based violence are committed before, during and after the conflict.”
There is one indicator on conflict prevention and disarmament: “Number and proportion of measures for conflict prevention, including control of small arms and light firearms and disarmament, and mediation (support), peacebuilding, peace negotiations, stabilisation, reconstruction and humanitarian assistance, which used gender-sensitive conflict analysis or requirements analysis, or other gender-responsive instruments for analysis”."
Ghana,"Ghana adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2020 for the period 2020-2025. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection (MoGCSP) with participation and collaboration with local (WPSI KAIPTC, WILPF Ghana), regional (WANEP) and international (UNDP, Canadian High Commission) partners. The NAP acknowledges the inputs received from the Women, Peace and Security Institute-Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre (WPSI-KAIPTC), West Africa Network for Peacebuilding (WANEP) and WILPF Ghana in the development of the NAP while also stating that civil society will be included in the NAP implementation process. The overall goal of the NAP is “to build inclusive, secure and safe societies for women and girls in Ghana anchored on the tenets of UNSCR 1325” (p. 13). The NAP is structured with reference to the main pillars of UNSCR 1325: participation; protection; prevention; and recovery and rehabilitation. The NAP focuses heavily on advancing the implementation of Resolution 1325 through increased institutional structures, collaborations with stakeholders, creating a resource base, and strengthening monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. While the NAP has a detailed implementation matrix, it does not include an allocated budget. Ghana’s second NAP is preceded by one other NAP, adopted in 2010, launched in 2012, and implemented for the 2012-2014 period. The first NAP was developed by the Ministry of Women and Children’s Affairs with broad-based participation from civil society. The original implementation period of the NAP was 2012-2014, but the plan could not be put into effect for 2012 as a result of the amount of time it took to formally adopt it. There were also some critical gaps in the NAP’s implementation: unavailability of an inter-ministerial steering committee to coordinate the implementation in a concerted manner; lack of a dedicated budget for the implementation; lack of a fundraising strategy and initiatives to raise funds to complement the Ministry’s limited annual government funding; competing priorities and resources in the various implementing sector ministries; lack of coordination between different stakeholders; non-availability of a pool of women with capacity in Women Peace and Security (WPS) to spearhead the implementation coordinated by MoGCSP; and lack of awareness of the NAP among various security institutions and the general public (p. 6). The second NAP seeks to address the lessons learned and overcome the challenges faced in the implementation of Ghana’s first NAP. Ghana reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country provided the following updates, among others: The Kofi Annan International Peace Keeping Training Centre continues train an average of 100 professionals on Gender, Peace and Security every year. The Ghana Police Service has developed a gender policy to mainstream gender in their operations and administration. The Bureau of National Investigations has also established a gender office with a senior officer as the head. This agency currently has 52% women of the total staff population (p. 18). Ghana gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1957, after decades of colonial rule under the British empire. The country experienced multiple military coups in 1966, 1972, and 1981. Ghana does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but has experienced sporadic ethnic tension with adverse impacts on especially women and girls. In 2011, Ghana established a Women, Peace, and Security Institute with the goal to increase women’s participation in peace negotiations, peacekeeping activities, and preventive diplomacy efforts in Africa. At the multilateral level, Ghana was most recently a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2006-2007.",1986,107,2015,244M,,"GHANAP 1

The NAP is structured along the main UNSCR 1325 pillars of; 1. Participation 2. Protection 3. Prevention 4. Relief, Recovery and Rehabilitation. 
 Each of these pillars has a specific goal and objectives. For instance: 
For Pillar 1 i.e. Participation, the specific goal is “participation and representation of women in decision making and peace process ensured”. The objectives of the pillar include: Increase the participation of women in conflict management and peacebuilding activities; Increase the participation of women on WPS issues at traditional, local, district and national levels; Enhance capacities for gender-sensitive external and internal peacekeeping operations.",,"GHANAP 2
Each Pillar in the NAP has indicators for their respective objectives. For instance, the NAP Pillar 3 (Prevention) has the following indicators: Level of awareness on law and policies on WPS among population; Number of reported cases on SGBV; Number of domestic peacekeeping found guilty and sanctioned for SGBV; Number of personnel found guilty and prosecuted.","GHANAP 1
The NAP states that the services of a Consultant will be contracted for the Monitoring and Evaluation of the coordination and implementation process. Included in the ""Next Steps"" is the establishment of an Inter-Ministerial Committee to assist in monitoring the implementation of the NAP.

Guatemala,"Guatemala adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2017, but the NAP does not identify a specific period of implementation. The NAP was developed by the Inter-Agency Roundtable on Women, Peace and Security (MIMPAZ), which was established in 2012 with the specific goal to promote and facilitate Guatemala’s implementation of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) resolutions. Guatemala’s NAP contextualizes the WPS agenda by providing a detailed overview of national and international legal frameworks, focusing on specific developments that propelled the advancement of women’s rights. The NAP also offers a gender equality analysis of women’s participation in peace negotiations, executive and legislative bodies, and the security and justice sector in Guatemala. The NAP situates the suggested action items within the country’s post-war context, highlighting the links between wartime aggression and post-conflict violence perpetrated against women. The NAP’s overarching objectives lie in mainstreaming gender equality and women’s rights across the country’s social and political spectrum. These objectives have corresponding actions and entities responsible for implementation. Nevertheless, the NAP does not include an allocated budget, with each implementing entity held responsible for financing assigned actions. The most recent conflict in Guatemala’s history is the Guatemalan Civil War, which lasted from 1960 until 1996, leaving 200,000 casualties as well as thousands of disappeared and displaced people. The conflict had a distinct gendered impact on women, with sexual violence used as a weapon of war. Within the context of the war, women began organizing in the 1980s to protest against the killings and disappearance of their loved ones. Women were also actively involved in the peace talks through their advocacy as part of the Women’s Sector in the Assembly of Civil Society, which was formed to bring civil society recommendations to Track I negotiations. Thanks to the work of diverse women’s organizations, 11 out of the 13 final accords addressed gender equality and women’s rights, with five accords including specific provisions on promoting women’s rights. Nevertheless, only two women were included in the formal peace negotiation delegations. Despite their involvement in the country’s post-war reconstruction, women in Guatemala are still grappling with the remnants of the war. Increased sexual violence and rape continue to affect women, with indigenous women disproportionately being impacted by rights violations and discrimination. In 2017, two former military officers were convicted with charges of sexual slavery during the war. This landmark proceeding (known as the “Sepur Zarco case”) led to the recognition of sexual slavery as a crime in a national court for the first time as well as granting reparation measures to the survivors. In 2019, amidst growing national and international pressure, the Guatemalan Congress backed down on passing an amnesty bill, which would have freed military officers convicted of human rights violations. In 2019, Guatemala was among the top 10 countries in the world with the biggest increase in their military expenditure, with a 24% increase in its military spending.",1982,113,2016,344M,"NAP Development
The NAP indicates that “specialized and local civil society organizations that address issues related to the human rights of women in conflict and post-conflict situations, transitional justice, security and justice,” were involved in the development of the NAP during a consultation process in 2013. 
WILPF does not have a country section in Guatemala and therefore was not involved in the development process of Guatemala’s NAP.
The NAP was developed by Guatemala’s Inter-Agency Roundtable on Women, Peace and Security, which is composed of various governmental bodies (a full list can be found on page 12 of the NAP).  
NAP Implementation
The NAP indicates that the action plan has been designed in a way to “allow opening spaces with civil society organizations” (p. 14). Additionally, “creating dialogues with civil society” is mentioned as part of the technical-operational actions for objectives 1 and 4 (pp. 45 and 51-52). However, the NAP does not specify how or which civil society organizations will be involved in the implementation of the NAP. 
The Inter-Agency Roundtable on Women, Peace and Security will oversee the overall implementation of the NAP. Additionally, specific governmental bodies are tasked with carrying out specific objectives. 
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
The NAP does not indicate civil society involvement in the monitoring and evaluation of the NAP.
The NAP will be monitored and evaluated by the Inter-Agency Roundtable on Women, Peace and Security as well as specific governmental bodies responsible for implementing the NAP. ",The NAP does not identify a specific timeframe for implementation.,"The NAP identifies five objectives (referred to as “pillars”):
Pillar 1: Empowerment and participation of women
Pillar 2: Training and development of women
Pillar 3: Respect for women's human rights
Pillar 4: Women's leadership for peacebuilding
Pillar 5: Dignified and transformational reparation of human rights violations for women in conflict and post-conflict situations",,"The NAP states that the Inter-Agency Roundtable on Women, Peace and Security has “developed a series of monitoring indicators, linked to global indicators, which will facilitate the regular reporting of these actions to the United Nations Security Council” (p. 6). However, the NAP does not specify what the indicators are.","The NAP mentions the development of a “system of monitoring and evaluation” (p. 12).

Guinea,"Guinea adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2009 for the period 2009-2013. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Social Affairs, of Women and Childhood Promotion, but did not include civil society involvement. The NAP identifies five overarching objectives (“priority intervention axes”): integration of gender questionnaire in development policies and programs; involvement of women and girls in the peace process as well as prevention, management, and settlement of conflicts; protection of women and girls from sexual violence and female genital mutilation; strengthening of integration of women in policy decision processes; and strengthening coordination and partnership for stated interventions. These objectives have corresponding actions and an estimated budget, but lack a monitoring and evaluation framework. Guinea reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country provided the following updates, among others (pp. 10-11): Development of the 2nd National Action Plan for the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 and related UNSCR 1325 on Women, Peace and Security for the period 2014-2018. A gender and equity unit has been established within the Ministry of National Defense, responsible for monitoring and implementing Resolution 1325. The capacities of the gender and equity department have been strengthened due to the interest generated at the level of the said Ministry in the area of gender; the head of the gender department is solicited in the sub-regional meetings on women and peace. Existence of a national committee to combat the proliferation of small arms and light weapons as part of the fight against arms trafficking. Guinea gained independence from France in 1958, after decades of colonial rule. The country underwent two military coups, in 1984 and 2008. Following the 2009 elections, Guinea experienced political unrest, resulting in the death of protestors as well as the deliberate targeting of women with sexual violence. In 2000, Guinea became home to up to half a million refugees fleeing armed conflicts in Sierra Leone and Liberia. In December 2013, Guinea witnessed the beginnings of the Ebola outbreak, which spread to neighboring countries as well as having a disproportionate impact on women due to preexisting and long-standing structural and gender inequalities. At the multilateral level, Guinea most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2002-2003.",1982,125,2014,195M,"NAP Development

Guinea Bissau,"Guinea-Bissau adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2010 for the period 2010-2011. The NAP was developed by the Comite de Pilotagem Nactional (IMC), in consultation with civil society organizations, including women’s organizations. The NAP identifies four overarching goals: prevention; participation; protection; help and community relocation; and monitoring and evaluation. The NAP particularly highlights increasing women’s participation in peace processes and decision-making venues. While the NAP identifies a steering committee for the identified actions, it lacks indicators as well as a monitoring and evaluation framework. The NAP does not have an allocated budget. Guinea-Bissau gained independence in 1974 from Portugal, following an eleven-year war of independence that began in 1963. Guinea-Bissau has experienced long-term political instability since its independence, including a civil war from 1998 until 1999. The most recent political instability that took place in the country was the 2012 military coup, which led to the intervention of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to devise a six-point roadmap for peace that resulted in the signing of the Conakry Accord in 2016. Women have been pivotal to peacebuilding efforts in the country, in particular through the creation of the Group of Women Facilitators in 2017. In addition to mediating meetings between leaders, the Group works towards increasing women’s meaningful participation in politics as well as ensuring gender-sensitive policy making.",1985,,2018,,"NAP Development
Representatives from Civil Society Organizations, Political Parties, Women Organizations and International Organizations have participatory roles in the development and implementation of the NAP.
WILPF does not have a country section in Guinea-Bissau and therefore was not involved in the development process of Guinea-Bissau’s NAP.

Civil society organizations and women's organizations, in general, are mentioned as being a part of the National Steering Committee that will be appointed by the government for monitoring and evaluating the NAP.
Those involved in monitoring and evaluation as part of the National Steering Committee include: A representative of the Prime Minister, a representative of Parliament, The Ministry of National Defence, Ministry of Family, Women, and Social Cohesion, Ministry of the Interior, National Police, Political Parties, and Steering Committee of the Peacebuilding Mission.","Guinea-Bissau's NAP is for the period 2010-2011, and also gives timeframes for many actions, but not all. These timeframes specify a particular month in 2011 (e.g. June 2011).","Guinea-Bissau's NAP outlines four objectives that follow the four pillars of UNSCR 1325 (Prevention, Protection, Participation, Relief and Recovery):

To better monitor the practical implementation of this action plan, it is necessary to create a solid structure that covers all the political and social awareness in the country. In fact, a good implementation of the PNA 1325 requires an effective system of monitoring and evaluation, responsible for its implementation. 
It is in this context that State institutions were selected, women's organisations and civil society to be part of the structure called Steering Committee.

Iceland,"Iceland adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2018 for the period 2018-2022. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with some input from civil society. The review of the second NAP by civil society contributed to the third NAP. The NAP approaches the implementation of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda mostly internationally, seeking to implement UNSCR 1325 and coordinate activities related to humanitarian, diplomatic, peacekeeping and development. The NAP is organized around four primary pillars: training and advocacy; participation; prevention, protection, relief and recovery; and partnership and collaboration. Each pillar has corresponding actions and indicators. The NAP does not have an allocated budget. Iceland’s third NAP is preceded by two other NAPs, adopted in 2008 and 2013. The first NAP did not specify a period of implementation while the second NAP was implemented for the period 2013-2016. A key strength of the third NAP is that it continues to recognize partnerships as a separate priority area based on the idea that partnerships have a multiplier effect. The third NAP is more specific than its predecessor but it still mostly has the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as responsible for activities. This updated NAP is constructed in the same structure as the previous NAP by consisting of four main pillars, each proposing ideal outcomes, outputs and activities in order to achieve each goal. However, the third NAP joined together prevention, protection, relief and recovery into one objective instead of separate ones as seen in the previous NAP. Finally, the updated NAP, like the two previous ones, does not include any reference to disarmament. Iceland does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but is a key contributor to UN peacekeeping missions, NATO missions, and provider of international aid and humanitarian assistance. Despite being a NATO member , Iceland does not have a military. Iceland has relatively high levels of gender equality and institutional protections for women’s rights. Currently, women make up approximately 40% of elected representatives in Iceland’s parliament. Iceland is also a member of the Nordic Women Mediators Network, which was launched in 2015. At the multilateral level, Iceland was a candidate for a non-permanent member seat at the United Nations Security Council for the period 2009-2010, but was not elected.",1985,1,2013,,"NAP Development
Civil society formed part of the development of the NAP  by providing recommendations from the previous NAP.
WILPF does not have a country section in Iceland and therefore was not involved in the development process of Iceland’s NAP.
The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
NAP Implementation
Civil society is not included as an implementing actor of the updated NAP.
The lead and cooperating implementing agencies are government ministries and institutions.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
Civil society, along with the steering group 1325 will be responsible for the mid-term review of the NAP. The mid-term review will assess if the objectives and the time-limits of output and activities apply as well as if amendments to the NAP are needed.
The steering group 1325 is responsible for collecting information from responsible parties for activities outlined in the NAP. The progress reports will then be turned into a summary that will be published by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs at the end of every year of implementation. This summary will also be submitted to the parliament yearly.",The fourth NAP is to be implemented in a period of five years 2018-2022.,"Similar to the previous NAP, this NAP has four priority areas.
The four main pillars of the National Action Plan are presented in the following order:
1) Training and advocacy;
2) Participation;
3) Prevention, protection, relief and recovery;
4) Partnership and collaboration.
For each of these four objectives, Iceland's NAP outlines a set of additional ""Outcomes"" or specific objectives. For example, under Participation, they include:
Increased participation of women and subsequent impact on peace and reconstruction, in Iceland and internationally;
Support and training of women in conflict zones which is of use in peace processes and reconstruction at an international level.",,"For each ""Outcome"" there is also a set of indicators. For example, under Prevention, Protection, Relief and Recovery's first outcome - ""Women and girls in conflict-affected situations are protected against violence and will receive relief and recovery"", they give the following indicators:
A course for Icelandic NGOs held twice during the period of validity of the NAP. Estimated cost: 500 thousand Icelandic krona per course.
Percentage of grants/funding provided to Icelandic NGOs' projects that promote and strengthen protection against sexual violence in conflict situations and/or relate to the rehabilitation of victims
Contributions to projects implemented by local NGOs and/or international organisations that focus on the protection of women and support to victims of violence.
Contributions will amount to a minimum of 10 million Icelandic krona per year, including contribution under item 3.2
 ",,The funding of the implementation of the NAP falls primarily on the Defence Directorate and the Directorate for International Development Cooperation of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.,Iceland does not mention disarmament in its revised NAP.
Indonesia,"Indonesia launched its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2014 for the period 2014-2019. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of People’s Welfare. While the NAP does not indicate civil society involvement, several civil society organizations were involved in the drafting of the NAP as well as being involved in its implementation. The NAP approaches the implementation of the WPS agenda mostly domestically, with the goal to protect and empower women and children during conflicts. The NAP has three overarching sections, which focus on preventive programs; resolution programs; and empowerment and participation programs. Each of these sections have specific actions and indicators, but the monitoring and evaluation framework solely consists of meetings to evaluate progress on actions identified in the NAP. Furthermore, the NAP does not include an allocated budget. The most recent armed conflict in Indonesia’s history is the Aceh conflict, which took place between 1976 and 2005 between the Indonesian government and the pro-independence Free Aceh Movement (known as Gerakan Aceh Merdeka or GAM), which demanded the independence of the Aceh region from Indonesia. The conflict concluded with a peace agreement signed in 2005, but the agreement did not include gender-sensitive provisions. Additionally, the peace agreement called for the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission , which held its first public hearing in 2018. Previously, Indonesia occupied Timor-Leste in 1975, with ongoing presence in the country until 2002, when a referendum in Timor-Leste resulted in favor of independence.",1984,85,,7.6B,"NAP Development
The RAN P3A-KS does not include any mention to “civil society” and thus, it does not mention its participation in the development or implementation. Nonetheless, the Indonesian Government hold consultations with civil society, including women’s groups, and that the monitoring process is being performed by members of civil society. Civil society - has been actively involved since the drafting process of the NAP in Indonesia, with active groups including: AMAN Indonesia, the Gender Based Violence organisation, and the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI).
WILPF does not have a country section in Indonesia and therefore was not involved in the development process of Indonesia’s NAP.
The development of the RAN P3A-KS was led by the Minister of People’s Welfare.
NAP Implementation
Civil society organizations are taking concerted action for the NAP implementation at the local level. Local NGOs are coordinating NGO networks at the regional level with aiming to drafting Local Action Plans to make implementation more effective. They work with local government representatives to build capacity and political will for addressing emerging challenges.
On the one hand, the RAN P3A-KS established the Team Coordination Centre as well as the Working Groups to be responsible for NAP implementation in Indonesia. However, there is no mention in the text of the specific actors are involved in these groups. On the other hand, in order to fulfill the goals established in the plan, the following governmental offices are to take the lead in different actions: National Commission on Women Empowerment and Child Protection or KPP PA (Activities coordinator), Indonesian Police,  Ministry of Law and Human Rights, Ministry of Communication & Information, Ministry of Home Affairs, Attorney General Office, National Commission on Child Protection (KPAI),  National Commission for Women, Ministry of Law and Human Rights (Activities coordinator), Ministry of Social Affairs, Indonesian Institute of Science (LIPI), Ministry of Defense, Indonesian Armed Force, Ministry of Development of Disadvantaged Regions, Ministry of Home Affairs, Ministry of Education and Culture, Ministry of Religious Affairs, Public Information Commission, the Indonesian Red Cross (PMI).
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
There is no mention of civil society participation in the monitoring and evaluation process in the NAP.
 According to the NAP, the Central Coordination Team, which is made up with RAN P3A-KS Working Groups in provinces and districts/cities, will coordinate, monitor, evaluate and report the implementation of the NAP - KS P3A to ensure synergy and continuity of the steps of protecting and empowering women and children during conflicts.",The timeframe set for the RAN P3A-KS is from 2014-2019. It is set to be implemented gradually and continuously consisting of a preparation stage by 2014 and an implementation stage in 2015-2019.,"The RAN P3A-KS program consists of series of activities carried out in a systematic and planned manner to protect and empower women as well as children during social conflicts, as an integral part of social conflict resolution activities. In order to do so, the RAN P3A-KS program is divided into 3 sections:
Preventive programs;
Resolution programs;
Empowerment and participation programs.","Every section in the NAP has its own issues to address and the actions that are considered priority in order to do so. For instance, in the first section, “Preventive programs”, the first issue refers to “The absence of accurate data and studies on women and children in conflict areas” and the goal set is to “Provide data and studies on women and children in conflicts areas”. In order to do so, there are two activities set:
Mapping data on women and children in conflicts areas;
Conduct studies of gender-based violence cases from conflicts.","The issues located along the three sections, have different goals, which have their own indicators. In the case of the second section, “Handling program”, the first issue is “Incomplete accurate data on women and children who need care in conflict areas” and the goal set is “Provides data on women and children who need care in conflict areas. In order to achieve it, the indicator set is “Data on women and children who need care in conflict areas”.","There are three governmental actors that will coordinate the efforts to achieve the goals set. The preventive program coordinator is the Ministry of Women Empowerment and Child Protection, the Handling program coordinator is the National Police, and the Empowerment and Participation program coordinator is the Ministry of Social Affairs.
A core team of National Coordinating Team has regular meetings to review the implementation and strengthening coordination within the Ministry of Women Empowerment and Child Protection and the Ministry of Human Development and Culture.","Despite stating that the funding needed to implement RAN P3A-KS shall be allocated from the budgets of the respective ministries/institutions, the NAP does not mention the amount of money allocated for each activity. Moreover, it does not include strategies or mechanisms to ensure activities are funded within departmental budgets. Finally, no indicators or actions are included that formulate strategies for sourcing increased funding, detail what level of funding is required for which specific activities, or what accountability mechanisms will ensure funding is raised and used in implementing RAN P3A-KS.",The Indonesia NAP does not mention disarmament or any specific actions to be taken.
Iraq,"Analysis on the 2021-2024 NAP is forthcoming. Iraq adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2014 for the period 2014-2018, making it the first country in the MENA region to adopt a NAP. The NAP was developed by the Federal Government of Iraq and the Kurdistan Regional Government with cooperation between the Ministry of Women’s Affairs, Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Defense in Baghdad and Ministry of Interior and Women’s High Council in Kurdistan along with the Iraqi NAP 1325 Initiative (I-NAP1325 Initiative), which consists of women’s rights organizations and networks across Iraq and Kurdistan. The NAP is organized around six pillars: participation; protection and prevention; promotion; social and economic empowerment; legislation and law enforcement; resources mobilization and monitoring and evaluation. Each pillar has a set of objectives, generally aimed at protecting and promoting the rights of women to increase their participation in decision-making spaces as well as raising awareness about the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda. The NAP has an allocated budget, broken down by strategic objectives and corresponding years. Iraq reported on the implementation of its NAP in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, Iraq indicated that the second NAP for the period 2019-2023 is currently being drafted with the support of UN Women and will also include “the active participation of women in peace and security efforts and the prioritization of their needs in planning, programme development and implementation.” The most recent large-scale armed conflict in Iraq’s history was the US invasion of Iraq, which lasted from 2003 until 2011, followed by conflict caused by ISIS/Daesh. Coupled with decades of prior armed conflict, including the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988) and the Gulf War (1990-1991), the invasion exacerbated the political instability in the country. These conflicts, as well as the UN sanctions imposed on Iraq following the Gulf war, had a disproportionate impact on women and girls, furthering structural inequalities that impeded their participation in social, political, and economic life.",1986,152,,7.5B,"NAP Development

Ireland,"Ireland adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2019 for the period 2019-2024. The NAP was developed by a working group that included representatives from the government, civil society, and academia. The NAP takes a holistic approach to the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) Agenda, emphasizing the country’s overarching commitment to advance gender equality in all endeavors and to further examine the gendered impacts of poverty, inequality, climate change, and conflict. In line with this approach, the NAP not only recognizes the need for women’s meaningful participation in matters pertaining to peace, security, and conflict prevention, but also highlights the need for a root cause analysis that examines gender norms that lead to violence, inequality, and conflict (p. 6). The NAP approaches the implementation of the WPS Agenda both domestically and internationally, and emphasizes the interconnected nature of these two realms. Internationally, the NAP identifies Northern Ireland, Israel/Palestine, Liberia, Sierra Leone, South Africa, and Zimbabwe as key geographical areas to focus on for humanitarian, peacebuilding, and development action. The NAP also promotes an integrated agenda by linking WPS-related actions to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Despite its detailed implementation framework, the NAP does not contain allocated or estimated budget. Ireland’s third NAP is preceded by two other NAPs, adopted in 2011 and 2015 and implemented for the period 2011-2014 and 2015-2018, respectively. Civil society inclusion has been a consistent presence across all NAPs, with an effort to produce the NAP through a participatory approach. Specifically, Ireland’s third NAP was developed based on the findings and recommendations of the midterm and final reviews of the country’s second NAP, review of 48 written public consultation submissions, and three public consultation workshops attended by over 100 representatives from civil society, academia, and the government. Ireland’s three NAPs are similar in their level of detail and areas of focus, with the primary pillars of Resolution 1325–participation; protection; prevention; relief and recovery–adopted as the overarching goals of the NAPs. While the first NAP addresses disarmament through the narrow framework of disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) efforts alone, both the second and third NAP expand the disarmament focus with an emphasis on increasing a gender perspective and women’s inclusion in arms control and non-proliferation. Ireland does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but was party to the Good Friday Agreement (1998), which ended a decades-long conflict between Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom. Ireland has a longstanding policy of military neutrality , focused on promoting international peace and stability and refraining from joining military alliances. In line with this policy, the country is not a member of NATO, but is a signatory to NATO’s Partnership for Peace Program . While Ireland does not export arms, it is engaged in military equipment and technology exports , including equipment used in military aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles. Ireland also contributes to peacekeeping missions and humanitarian operations alongside being a contributor to humanitarian aid. Ireland is a contributing donor to the Women’s Peace and Humanitarian Fund , a global partnership that works to empower women in conflict zones and humanitarian crises. Ireland is also a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies, a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. At the multilateral level, Ireland currently serves as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2021-2022.",1985,7,2014,1.113B,"NAP Development

NAP Implementation
The NAP identifies civil society as a key contributor to the implementation of the WPS Agenda, both domestically and internationally. However, the NAP does not specify how or which civil society organizations will be included in the implementation process.   
The NAP takes a whole-of-government approach to the implementation of the WPS Agenda. As such, multiple government units are tasked with implementing different components of the NAP (p. 12):
The Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, who have developed their own action plan on WPS, will continue to build upon their work on the integration of WPS in UN and UN-mandated overseas peace operations;
Units across the Political and Development Cooperation and Africa Divisions in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will implement the plan regionally and internationally, in line with the new A Better World development policy;
The domestic dimension … will be led by the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda Síochána in conjunction with the Health Service Executive, and for the first time inputs will be provided by the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Community and Rural Development, and related state agencies.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
An oversight group, appointed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, will monitor the implementation of the NAP. In terms of its composition, fifty percent of the group will comprise government and state representatives and fifty percent will comprise civil society, academia, and independent representatives.

WILPF's Contributions to Ireland's NAP
WILPF submitted input to Ireland’s development of the third generation NAP on the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) Agenda. This submission provided recommendations for Ireland’s NAP on issues related to disarmament and demilitarization.",The implementation period of the NAP is five years (2019-2024).,"The NAP identifies nine objectives (referred to as “strategic outcomes”), compiled under the slightly modified four pillars of UNSCR 1325: prevention, participation, protection, and promotion. On Ireland’s NAP, prevention and participation each have three objectives, protection has two objectives, and promotion has one objective. For example, objective 1.2 listed under prevention is: “A gender analysis is integrated into Ireland’s work in conflict-affected contexts and on peace and security issues, including in relation to conflict prevention, peacebuilding and security policy and disarmament” (p. 15).
The NAP has a detailed monitoring framework that breaks down each objective with a corresponding actor, output, specific activities, performance indicators/milestone, implementation year, and department lead. For example, objective 1.2 listed under prevention identifies, “ensure a whole of department approach to conflict that is gender sensitive” as an output, and identifies “strengthen capacity and training around gender equality, GBV and gender-sensitive conflict analysis” as an activity (p. 28, monitoring framework).

For example, objective 1.2 listed under prevention identifies, “#N of trainings and capacity building that include gender equality, gender sensitive conflict analysis and GBV response training for DFAT staff and partners, including pre-posting training” as an indicator (p. 28, monitoring framework).","Ireland’s NAP has a multi-tier monitoring and evaluation design, composed of an overarching monitoring framework, an oversight group, two reviews, and state party periodic reporting obligations. The NAP indicates that the monitoring framework will be the “guiding vehicle through which progress will be measured” (p. 25) on identified objectives. Additionally, an oversight group, appointed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, will monitor the implementation of the NAP. Furthermore, a mid-term review of the NAP will be conducted in 2021 by independent consultants. The findings and recommendations of this review will be used to update the NAP for the remaining two years of its implementation (2022-2024). A final review, which will evaluate the achievements of the first, second, and third NAPs, will be conducted at the end of the third NAP (2024). Finally, the NAP will be integrated into state party periodic reporting obligations under CEDAW and the Universal Periodic Review, which will be coordinated by the oversight group.  ","Despite its detailed implementation framework, the NAP does not contain allocated or estimated budget. The NAP indicates that “all actions and indicators are mindful of and integrate those from relevant National Policies,” including “gender budgeting with the Departments of Finance and of Public Expenditure and Reform” (p. 25). Additionally, the NAP identifies allocating “a dedicated budget to NAP related activities in the areas of monitoring and data collection” (p. 46) as an activity for the objective listed under the promotion pillar. However, there is no specific information on the allocated or estimated budget. Instead, the NAP refers readers to a government website for more information on gender equality budgeting.","The Ireland NAP is infused with the importance of disarmament for promoting peaceful and inclusive societies, and includes a section on disarmament as a tool for conflict prevention. This section highlights the link between the risk of gender-based violence (GBV) and the disproportionate impact of weapons (including small arms, light weapons, and nuclear weapons) on women and girls while emphasizing that disarmament and arms control measures “will contribute to the reduction of GBV and acts as a long-term tool for the prevention of conflict, and the recurrence of violence in the post-conflict phase” (p. 16). 
The NAP also identifies “prioritizing the inclusion of women and their perspectives in disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation discussions” (p. 9) among the key highlights of the NAP. As such, disarmament is included in one of the objectives listed under the prevention pillar: “A gender analysis is integrated into Ireland’s work in conflict-affected contexts and on peace and security issues, including in relation to conflict prevention, peacebuilding and security policy and disarmament” (p. 15). 
Additionally, the NAP identifies furthering “work in understanding and challenging how harmful masculinities influence policies of disarmament and arms control, including conventional arms control, nuclear deterrence and other justifications for the possession of nuclear weapons” (p. 29) as an activity for objective 1.3 listed under the prevention pillar. "
Italy,"Italy adopted its fourth National Action Plan (NAP) in 2020 for the period 2020-2024. The NAP was developed by the Open-Ended Working Group on Women, Peace and Security of the Inter-Ministerial Committee for Human Rights (CIDU) with the input of a variety of stakeholders, including civil society. WILPF Italy participated in the NAP development process. The NAP positions itself within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had disproportionate impacts on women and girls and severely impacted Italy in the beginning of the pandemic. It aims to strengthen existing actions, strengthen an integrated approach, and broaden the scope of WPS actions in line with more recent resolutions and developments in the agenda. Previous NAPs were adopted in 2010, 2014, and 2016, and implemented for the period 2010-2013, 2014-2016, and 2016-2019, respectively. Italy’s first three NAPs identify the following among their primary goals: increasing the number of women in the military; promoting a gender perspective in peace operations, including training on Resolution 1325; protecting the rights of women, children, and vulnerable groups in conflict and post-conflict zones; strengthening the role of women in peace processes; and increasing civil society participation in implementing Resolution 1325. The NAPs approach the implementation of the WPS agenda both domestically and internationally, with preventing human trafficking and protecting refugees and asylum seekers as major areas of concern at the domestic level. Italy does not have a history of recent armed conflict, but is a contributor to peacekeeping and military operations. In 2019, Italy was also among the top 10 arms exporters in the world. Specifically, between 2015 and 2018, Italy made more than 700 million in euros through arms exports to Saudi Arabia. The Italian government stopped arms exports to Saudia Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, as a result of concerted civil society efforts that exposed the human rights violations during the war in Yemen. In 2019, Italy adopted a new law with extended measures to prevent gender-based violence. Despite this positive development for human rights, rights violations continue for migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers, including through anti-immigration policies and rhetoric. At the multilateral level, Italy most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for a one-year term in 2017, splitting the ordinarily two-year term with the Netherlands due to a deadlocked election result.",1985,76,2014,26.7B,"NAP Development
The Fourth Italian National Action Plan (2020-2024) was developed through a process led by the Open-Ended Working Group (OEWG) on Women, Peace and Security, itself led by the Inter-ministerial Committee for Human Rights (page 9). The development process included a number of virtual meetings that the NAP states included civil society, academia, trade unions, and other actors. These stakeholders are listed in Annex 2 of the Plan.
NAP Implementation and Monitoring
The implementation of the NAP will similarly be conducted through this multi-stakeholder mechanism, including the Working Group, civil society, and other stakeholders. There will be progress reporting that will be conducted with some civil society organizations (page 10). The OEWG is ultimately responsible for the implementation and monitoring of the NAP, and will meet at a minimum every four months. The NAP will also be reviewed on an annual basis in light of emerging issues and agendas and lessons learned. The NAP implementation will be monitored on a consistent basis, including in parliament. 
WILPF
Patrizia Sterpetti, President of WILPF Italia, is cited in the NAP as one of the stakeholders and experts who contributed to developing the Plan. She represented the Section in this role.","The National Action Plan will be implemented for four years, from 2020 to 2024.","The NAP positions itself within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had disproportionate impacts on women and girls and severely impacted Italy in the beginning of the pandemic. It aims to strengthen existing actions, strengthen an integrated approach, and broaden the scope of WPS actions in line with more recent resolutions and developments in the agenda.
The NAP has four stated objectives:
“Objective 1 - Strengthen – on a continuous and lasting basis - the role of women in peace processes and in all decision-making processes, also increasing synergies with civil society, in order to effectively implement UN Security Council Resolution 1325(2000) and the WPS Agenda 
Objective 2 - Continue to promote a gender perspective in peace operations and enhance the presence of women, in particular in the Armed Forces and Polices Forces, strengthening their role in decision-making processes relating to peace-keeping missions and in peace conferences 
Objective 3 – Contribute to promote gender equality, empowerment and protection of women and children, especially girls and boys, as well as respect for human rights of women and children, especially girls, in conflict and post-conflict areas, increasing synergies with civil society, in order to implement UN Security Council Resolution 1325(2000) and the WPS Agenda 
Objective 4 – Strengthen strategic communication and result-oriented advocacy, by bolstering the Italian participation in relevant fora, conferences and mechanisms (eg UN system, Red Cross, OSCE, NATO, EU, OECD, Council of Europe), to further support the implementation of the WPS Agenda while continuing to ensure the enhancement of information and training at all levels, on the various cross-cutting issues of UNSCR 1325(2000), in particular for the personnel participating in peace operations, including by increasing synergies with civil society and universities, in order to effectively implement UN Security Council Resolution 1325(2000) and the WPS Agenda.”",,"The NAP contains a series of indicators, which have been derived from other relevant frameworks including the UN Secretary-General’s report on WPS, and the EU approach and plan for WPS implementation
Examples of indicators include “11. Expenditures and proportion of resources of development cooperation programmes in partner countries as allocated for the WPS Agenda, gender equality, prevention and combat violence against women, peace-building and conflict prevention and N# of CSOs that participate in these programmes”, and 19. N# of women HRD, women peace-builders and women mediators who received support. ","The NAP states that it is envisioned as a 'living document', with the ability to adapt to the changing needs and obstacles experienced in the implementation process. Italy will publish an annual progress report, which will be prepared by the Interministerial Committee on Human Rights (CIDU).","The NAP does not identify a specific number for the budget, but there are numerous indicators that assess progress towards the NAP as being linked to financing. These include:
“9. Proportion of financed projects and initiatives relating to the WPS Agenda, which include relief and recovery programmes.” 
“11. Expenditures and proportion of resources of development cooperation programmes in partner countries as allocated for the WPS Agenda, gender equality, prevention and combat violence against women, peace-building and conflict prevention and N# of CSOs that participate in these programmes.”
“12. Total of expenditures, N# and details about projects that implement support services with regard to SGBV and other forms of violence against women, including information and services in the field of sexual and reproductive health.”","Under Objective 1, there is one action related to disarmament that is listed. This is Action 1.1: “Promote the direct, formal and meaningful participation of women and youth in peace processes and in all decision-making processes related to peace and security, as well as to international policy, disarmament and development, also in the light of the Youth, Peace and Security Agenda."
Japan,"Japan adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) for the period 2023-2028. The 2019-2022 NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in coordination with civil society, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), in particular with women’s groups, and experts in the evaluation committee, which monitored and evaluated the first NAP, adopted in 2015 for the period 2015-2018.  The 2019 NAP does not differ drastically from the 2015, rather it focused on smoothing out redundancies.  Structural changes will be reserved for the following NAP based on the experience of implementation. The 2015 and 2019 NAPs approach the implementation of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda both domestically and internationally, including reviewing the Japanese government’s policies and initiatives concerning assistance in the field of conflict prevention and peacebuilding from a gender perspective. The NAP addresses disarmament by highlighting the gendered impact of small arms and light weapons as well as gender-sensitive arms control measures. The NAP’s objectives are organized under four overarching goals that align with the primary pillars of UNSCR 1325: participation; conflict prevention; protection; and humanitarian and reconstruction. Each specific goal under the pillars is accompanied by a set of actions and indicators; however, the 2019 NAP still does not have a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation framework despite setting a goal to develop one in the 2015 NAP, nor does it have an allocated budget. Japan has not been involved in armed conflict since the end of World War II, as it adopted a military neutrality policy, which is enshrined in its constitution , that rejects the use of arms as a means to settle international disputes. Nevertheless, the country does have a military force, the Japanese Self-Defense Forces (SDF), and has witnessed sporadic, albeit unsuccessful, efforts to revise the pacifist constitution. Additionally, in 2019, Japan was among the top 10 countries with the highest military expenditure. In the current moment, Japan continues to have political tension with North Korea over the latter’s nuclear programme and with China and South Korea over disputed territory and Japan’s past wartime actions, including its colonial legacy and the sexual slavery of women, euphemistically refered to as “ comfort women ,” in occupied territories. Japan is a contributor to humanitarian aid, including as a contributing donor to the Women’s Peace and Humanitarian Fund , a global partnership that works to empower women in conflict zones and humanitarian crises. Japan is also a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies , a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. In 2019, Japan was the UN Women ’s fourteenth-largest regular resources contributor with USD 3.39 million and the seventh-largest total government contributor with USD 17.65 million. At the multilateral level, Japan most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2016-2017. In Japan’s constitution, renounce war and “desire peace for all time”, with the core principle of fundamental human rights, equality under the law and individual dignity.  It also has ‘the essential equality of the sexes in family life’ (p 2).  In 1999, Japan enacted the Basic Act for a Gender Equal Society and ​​established the Basic Plan for Gender Equality, which it promotes in tandem with its NAP, with the goal of gender equality a top priority for the 21st century.",1985,121,2014,47.6B,"The analysis in these tabs corresponds to the 2019-2022 NAP.
NAP Development
The 2019-2022 NAP was developed by Japan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  The second NAP reflected recommendations from the evaluation committee (a group of experts), and representatives from civil society and NGOs.
NAP Implementation
Implementation of the NAP will be carried out by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Japan International Cooperation Agency; the Reconstruction Agency; Fire and Disaster Management Agency; National Police Agency; Japan Coast Guard; Ministry of Justice; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; sections of the cabinet office (Gender Equality Bureau, Secretariat of the International Peace Cooperation Headquarters, and Disaster Management).
Civil society will be supported in implementation, but the NAP does not specify any direct involvement.
NAP monitoring and evaluation
Japan’s NAP does not specify specific bodies for monitoring and evaluation, rather it stipulates ‘All relevant ministries and agencies’ (p. 37-39).  It also does not specify which actors will develop the monitoring and evaluation framework.",The implementation period for Japan’s NAP is three years (2019-2022).,"The NAP is organized into four overarching goals that reflect the pillars of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 and the WPS agenda more broadly (p. 8).
Participation: Ensuring the equal and meaningful participation of women in all stages in the field of peace and security (including humanitarian relief, defense, diplomatic policies, and peacebuilding processes) with the goal of achieving gender mainstreaming, including introducing gender equality perspectives within decision-making at the national level.
Conflict prevention: Promoting women’s participation and their active and leading roles in all processes of prevention, management, and resolution of conflicts and in decision-making; strengthening a gender equal perspective. 
Protection: Protect various aid recipients including women and girls from sexual and gender-based violence and other human rights infringements during or after situations of conflict or humanitarian crisis; provide protection and assistance to survivors of this violence. 
Humanitarian relief, recovery and reconstruction assistance: Provide humanitarian relief, recovery and reconstruction assistance which reflect the special needs of women and girls; promote women’s empowerment and ensure women’s equal participation within aid assistance providers. ",,"For each action set out under the subset of goals, a set of indicators and the relevant agencies and departments for implementation are listed (p. 9-36).
 For example, the indicators and relevant agencies under Goal 3 under the ‘Conflict Prevention’ pillar (‘Promote women’s participation in conflict resolution, and assist them to take leadership and play active roles, and reflect gender perspective in peace negotiations’) are: 
Train women with advanced conflict resolution skills (negotiation, mediation and arbitration). Indicator: Status of women’s participation in training for enhancing conflict resolution skills provided at educational institutions in Japan and abroad. Agencies of implementation: Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).
Examine and study cases where women significantly contributed to conflict resolution, and extract lessons learned and success factors. Indicator: Implementation status of case studies on conflict resolution and women. Agencies of implementation: MOFA and JICA.
 ","The monitoring report of the implementation status of the Plan will be compiled by the government of Japan, based on the report of the evaluation committee, which will produce an evaluation report every two years. 
The actions set out aim to build a framework to effectively and regularly monitor, evaluate, and review the implementation of the NAP.  The government will review NAP after four years.",No budget has been indicated in the NAP.,"The NAP addresses disarmament by committing to the integration of gender perspectives in small arms and light weapons (SALW) control measures and recognizes the gendered impacts of illegal trade of SALW s in increasing the risk of SGBV in situations of conflict and/or humanitarian crisis.  The NAP sets out to strengthen regulations on the illegal trade of SALW, including through the status of UN resolutions and the implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT)."
Jordan,"Jordan adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2018 for the period 2018-2021 and its most recent NAP for the period 2022-2025. Analysis on the 2022-2025 NAP is forthcoming. The 2018-2021 NAP was developed by the Jordanian National Commission for Women and the National Coalition on UNSCR 1325, which was composed of over 60 representatives from government ministries, civil society organisations, security sector and international partners. The focus of the NAP is to ensure national and regional stability through gender equality and women’s participation, particularly in national peace and security efforts. These goals are guided by the four pillars of the Women, Peace and Security agenda – participation, protection, prevention, relief and recovery. The NAP grounds the WPS agenda in the country context, highlighting the need for a gender-sensitive approach to humanitarian response; recognising the varying needs of women in humanitarian crises; and emphasizing women’s agency in the prevention of violent extremism and radicalisation. However, there is no mention of disarmament in the NAP, which challenges further opportunities to deliver on the prevention and participation objectives. The NAP will be monitored and evaluated by all entities that contributed to its creation. In terms of budgeting, there is an inclusion of a national budget allocated for the goals of the NAP to be completed. Jordan reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country provided the following updates, among others (p.53): A communication strategy was developed for the National Plan of Action to Raise Awareness and Advocacy for the Women, Peace and Security Agenda for the years 2018-2021 … It was also necessary to clarify the key ideas behind its recommended approach to reach the target groups of outreach activities, particularly key partners outside the capital, to raise awareness and support for the national plan and its objectives. The National Committee for Women, in cooperation with the UN Women, began in 2018 to mobilize resources for the Joint Support Fund through which the activities of the plan will be implemented in the next phase, the estimated total cost of which is estimated at 7,820,000 million dinars for the years 2018-2021. The Canadian, British, Norwegian, Spanish, and Finnish governments pledged to support to the fund for the implementation of the plan, which was launched at a regional conference with international participation in February 2019. Jordan does not have a recent history of armed conflict; however, the country did intervene in military operations outside of its borders, including during the Arab-Israeli War (1948) as well as the Six-Day War (1967). Currently, Jordan is a host country to many refugees fleeing conflicts in other parts of its surrounding region, including from conflicts in Palestine, Syria, and Yemen. In 2019, Jordan was among the top 40 largest importers of arms in the world. Additionally, Jordan was among the top 10 countries globally with the highest military burden (military expenditure as a share of gross domestic product). At the multilateral level, Jordan most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2014-2015.",1992,138,2014,2B,"NAP Development
There are several mentions of civil society organisations forming part of the creation of the NAP; however, no specific civil society organisation is included.
WILPF does not have a country section in Jordan and therefore was not involved in the development process of  Jordan’s NAP.
The NAP notes the role of the various Ministries in the creation of the NAP including the Ministry. Notably, the Jordanian National Commission for Women  contributed to the creation of the NAP as a semi-governmental body.
NAP Implementation
Civil society organisations are included in the implementation of the NAP. For example, for objective 2 on “meaningful participation of women in preventing radicalisation and violent extremism and in national and regional peace building”, has civil society organisations (CSOs) along with international non-governmental organisations listed as potential actors involved in implementation. 
The framework for implementation of the NAP comprises of several parts because of the different pillars.   Different bodies are in charge of the implementation of different objectives.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
The same bodies included in the process of development are included in the monitoring and evaluation of the NAP, including civil society.
Government entities will form part of the monitoring and evaluation team through providing reports periodically and ultimately when the NAP ends. For instance, for the pillar pertaining to including women in  the security sector, the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Interior  will be responsible for creating an gendered audit on the Jordanian security sector to assess the work environment for women in the security sector.
Timeframe
The NAP implementation period is four years (2018-2021).",,"By 2021, the commitments of Jordan to Women, Peace and Security will be based on the following objectives:
Gender responsive security sector reform;
Preventing violent extremism and gender responsive peacebuilding;
Gender-sensitive humanitarian services;

Assess and revise current security sector training curriculums and infrastructure to be gender responsive;
Conduct a nationwide advocacy campaign targeting all governorates to raise awareness of the benefits and importance of women’s participation in peace and security etc.","To achieve each objective, the NAP has different indicators assigned. For example, Objective 1 on “gender responsiveness and meaningful participation of women in the security sector and peace operations” includes the following indicators or outcomes:
1.1  An environment within security sector that is responsive to the security needs and priorities of women, and conducive and favourable for women’s entry, advancement and leadership.
1.1.1 Obstacles for women to enter, advance and lead in the security sector, and recommendations for how to address these obstacles, are identified.

1.1.7 Institutional capacities within security sector to integrate gender perspectives and to respond to women’s security needs are strengthened across all security sector institutions.
Monitoring and Evaluation
In order to measure progress against the key pillars, all implementing parties will contribute to the monitoring and evaluation of the National Action Plan, as set by the respective the 3 monitoring and evaluation framework that has been prepared in a participatory approach with the members of the National Coalition.",,"The Jordanian Government has set aside a budget of $7,820,000 for the implementation of the NAP. Each goal has a certain portion of the total budget allocated towards reaching its specific goal.",The Jordanian NAP fails to address disarmament issue or connect the proliferation of weapons with women’s insecurity.
Kazakhstan,,1998,65,2017,1.617B,"Development
The Action Plan was developed by the National Commission for Women’s Affairs and Family and Demographic Policy, whose work is under the leadership of the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The United Nations representatives in Kazakhstan also contributed to the development of the NAP, including UN Women and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)

Kenya,"Kenya launched its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2020 for the period 2020-2024. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Public Service and Gender and the Ministry of Interior and Coordination of National Government. The NAP indicates and acknowledges the involvement of civil society organizations in the NAP development process, but does not specify which civil society actors were a part of the process. The NAP approaches the implementation of the WPS agenda both domestically and internationally, and has four overarching objectives that align with the key pillars of the UNSCR 1325: participation; prevention; protection; and relief and recovery. T he NAP addresses disarmament only briefly in the relief and recovery pillar, and through a narrow framework, to incorporate a gender-sensitive design into all disarmament, demobilization, and rehabilitation (DDR) efforts. While the NAP does have a detailed monitoring and evaluation framework, it does not include an allocated budget, instead holding various ministries and bodies at the national and county levels to allocate a part of their budget for the assigned activities. Kenya’s second NAP is preceded by one other NAP, adopted in 2016 and implemented for the period 2016-2018. The NAP compiles its objectives under four thematic pillars that align with the framework of Resolution 1325: participation and promotion; prevention; protection; relief and recovery. In 2019, Kenya carried out a review of their first NAP to assess the level of implementation, and the findings and recommendations of the review was utilized to inform the development of the second NAP. Specifically, the particular recommendations used for the development of the NAP included the following: deepen the institutionalization of the revised NAP; map out actors implementing the women, peace, and security agenda at all levels; strengthen the awareness and implementation of the NAP at the local level; and develop an effective monitoring and accountability system. Despite the revisions, the second NAP, similar to its predecessor, does not address disarmament beyond the narrow framework of disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) efforts. Kenya gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1963, after decades of colonial rule by the British empire. The most recent armed conflict in Kenya’s history took place after the presidential elections of 2007 and lasted until 2008. During this period of civil and political unrest, over 1,100 people were killed, more than 600,000 people displaced, and at least 900 cases of sexual violence were recorded. Survivors of sexual violence suffered significant physical and psychological trauma and socioeconomic hardship, worsened by the Kenyan government’s failure to provide measures such as medical care and psychosocial support. The conflict drew national and international attention and prompted the establishment of a Truth, Justice, and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC). More recently, Kenya has been experiencing further political instability as a result of Al Qaeda and Al Shabaab’s operations within Kenya’s boundaries and in neighbouring Somalia. Women’s security is greatly affected by these attacks by extremist groups alongside the proliferation of small arms and light weapons.",1984,109,,1.148B,"CIVIL SOCIETY ACTORS
NAP DEVELOPMENT
The KNAP II acknowledges the involvement of civil society organizations (CSOs), and academic and faith-based organizations “for their invaluable contribution and tireless efforts throughout the entire process towards the successful completion of the document. While the NAP was developed through a “consultative, participatory and collaborative effort”, the involvement of specific CSOs in the NAP development process was not listed. 
NAP IMPLEMENTATION 
CSOs are not the lead implementing agencies of the NAP, however, they are required to support the Ministry of Public Service and Gender and other ministries in the implementation of the interventions in various ways. 
NAP MONITORING AND EVALUATION 
CSOs are involved in the community level reporting wherein they are required to share a quarterly progress report to the County Technical Working Group. 
 GOVERNMENT ACTORS
NAP DEVELOPMENT
The development of the KNAP II was led jointly by the Ministry of Public Service and Gender (State Department for Gender), and the Ministry of Interior and Coordination of National Government.
NAP IMPLEMENTATION 
The Ministry of Public Service and Gender will provide strategic leadership and overall guidance and supervision for the implementation of the KNAP II. “The Ministry will co-chair the process with the Ministry of Interior and Coordination of National Government. These two lead ministries will work closely with other key ministries, departments, and agencies at the national and county level, with civil society organizations, including women’s organizations, and with academia and the private sector to implement and deliver on the commitments of KNAP II.”
NAP MONITORING AND EVALUATION 
The National Steering Technical Committee will be the lead body for the monitoring and evaluation of KNAP II. “The committee will be chaired by the Ministry of Public Service and Gender (State Department for Gender) and co-chaired by the Ministry of Interior and Coordination of National Government (Directorate of Peacebuilding and Conflict Management)”.","KNAP II was adopted for the period 2020-2024. The NAP also mentions a timeframe for all the pillars and outputs in its implementation matrix. The baseline is 2020, and the milestones are to be achieved in 2021, 2022 and 2023 and the target in 2024.","The critical pillars in KNAP II include: Participation and Promotion; Prevention; Protection; Relief and Recovery. The objectives of these pillars are as follows: 
To increase the inclusive and effective engagement of women at all decision-making levels in peace, security, and disaster management
To enhance the prevention of conflict and all forms of violence against women, girls, and vulnerable groups through gender-sensitive institutional, structural, and social transformation 
To protect women and girls and other vulnerable groups, including migrants, refugees, and internally displaced persons, in all forms of conflict and violence. 
To ensure women and girls have the capacity to effectively engage in relief and recovery, and have access to services in humanitarian settings, including periods of disaster/crisis ","Each of the pillars have various outputs which then have interventions/actions assigned. For instance, in pillar 2: prevention, for the output: “Gender-responsive early warning systems, disaster management, and conflict prevention mechanisms and strategies strengthened”, the actions included are:
Integrate gender responsiveness into early warning and early response systems and into conflict prevention mechanisms, including the prevention of violent extremism.
Conduct research on the use of existing indigenous and traditional knowledge on women’s roles in early warning and early response.","Each of the pillars have various outputs and respective interventions and indicators. For instance, for pillar 3: Protection and the output, “Laws and policies that protect women’s and girls’ rights strengthened and implemented”, the indicators are as follows: 
Number of laws, policies, and measures adapted and reviewed that protect and promote women’s and girl’s human rights in line with regional and international standards
 Number of measures taken by national and county governments to implement human rights provisions that protect women’s and girl’s rights
Number of duty bearers and rights holders reached through awareness-raising initiatives on existing laws that protect women’s and girl’s rights",The NAP includes a detailed plan for the monitoring and evaluation of the actions. The National Steering Technical Committee is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the KNAP II. The committee will also oversee the development and submissions of the quarterly and yearly reports.,"There is no particular earmarked budget to implement the various interventions stated. However, the NAP states that it is the responsibility of various ministries and bodies at the national and county levels to allocate a part of their budget for the activities.","The KNAP II addresses disarmament under the relief and recovery pillar which focuses on incorporating a gender-sensitive design into all disarmament, demobilization, and rehabilitation efforts and peace support initiatives. "
Kosovo,"Kosovo adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2014 for the period 2013-2015. The NAP was developed by the Agency on Gender Equality in the Office of the Prime Minister in cooperation with the working group, which consisted of central governmental entities and civil society members, and with the support of UN Women and OHCHR. The NAP identifies its main objectives as the promotion and protection of women’s human rights as well as the recognition of the victims of the Kosovo War. Additionally, the NAP identifies three outcomes: increased participation of women in decision-making and peacekeeping and building processes; integrated gender perspectives in security affairs and increased women’s participation in the security structures; and improved access to protection, justice, rehabilitation, and reintegration for survivors of sexual violence, torture, and other forms of violence associated with conflict/war. Each outcome has a set of indicators, as well as a corresponding budget line for estimated costs, but the NAP does not specify how monitoring and evaluation will be carried out. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, although the international recognition of its sovereignty remains contentious. The most recent armed conflict in Kosovo’s history was the Kosovo War, which lasted from 1998 until 1999 and took place between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and the Kosovo Liberation Army. Marking the end of a NATO intervention in Kosovo in 1999, the United Nations Security Council authorized the establishment of an international civil presence in Kosovo–United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK). The International Court of Justice ruled that the declaration of independence was in line with international law, and peace talks between Kosovo and Serbia began in 2011 where the EU acted as a mediator. Despite the war’s disproportionate gendered impacts , women in Kosovo continue to be underrepresented in high-level decision-making spaces related to peace and security.",,,2014,65.7M,"NAP Development
The NAP was drafted through a multi-sectoral and all-inclusive approach which included the participation of  government representatives, representatives of judicial institutions and civil society as members of a working group responsible for the development of the NAP. The members of the working group drafting the NAP  worked alongside, and were supported by, UN Women and OHCHR.
WILPF does not have a country section in Kosovo and was therefore not involved in the development of the NAP.
The government of Kosovo started drafting the NAP in 2012 where the Agency on Gender Equality in the Office of the Prime Minister created a working group which started working on the draft.  The working group entailed 28 members and drafted the NAP through a ‘multi-sectoral and all-inclusive approach ensured by the participation of the central institutions of the Republic of Kosovo with senior officials and representatives of the judicial institutions and civil society’. The process was supported by UN Women and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR).
NAP Implementation
The NAP is meant to be a flexible and dynamic document to adapted in line with national economic and social changes. The Kosovo Government institutions are the primary actors responsible for its implementation but civil society organisations, including women's groups, are noted as actors who work in a coordinated manner at both a central and a local level where they have made gender issues a priority issue in government policies and programs.
The NAP highlights the Kosovo Women's Network (KWN) consisting of 87 organizations representing women of all ethnic groups and communities in Kosovo. The KWN works on gender-based violence and providing advocacy groups and legal support.
The Working group establishes that the implementation of the NAP requires the coordination of governmental and non-governmental bodies. However, primary responsibility for implementing the NAP does lie with the Kosovo Government institutions.
The NAP was developed following the Kosovo Program for Gender Equality (KPGE)  which was a strategic document defining goals, objectives, policies and actors responsible for implementing gender equality in all fields of social and economic life in Kosovo from  2008 to 2013. The plan included strategic objectives and budgetary costs. The objectives included ‘increased participation of women in decision-making and in processes of building and preserving peace’.
The NAP also notes the role of ‘Gender equality officials’ which are appointed to all ministries and municipalities where they are responsible for drafting and implementation policies and activities promoting gender equality. They furthermore oversee the implementation of the Law on Gender Equality and strategic policies for gender equality, such as the KPGE, the Program against domestic violence, the Working Plan for economic empowerment etc.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
The NAP will change over the years as a result of lessons learned and challenges during the implementation process which will be set out in evaluation and monitoring reports.
A  coordination and monitoring unit for the implementation of the NAP was set up by Deputy Prime Minister of Kosovo, Ms. Mimoza Kusari-Lila when the Agency for Gender Equality was defined as the institution responsible for monitoring the implementation. How the monitoring will take place is not concretely stated in the NAP.
The role of civil society is noted as ‘Civil society organizations have a strong commitment to promoting and monitoring the implementation of Resolution 1325 in Kosovo’. How civil society will assist in the monitoring of the NAP is however not described in detail in the NAP.
A coordination and monitoring unit for the implementation of the NAP was set up by Deputy Prime Minister of Kosovo, Ms. Mimoza Kusari-Lila when the Agency for Gender Equality was defined as the institution responsible for monitoring the implementation. How the monitoring will take place is not concretely stated in the NAP.","The timeframe of the Kosovo NAP is 2013-2015. Most activities listed have the same timeframe as the NAP itself. However, some have a specific year in which they are to be completed, for instance activity 1.1.2 'training women and girls in political party forums and youth forums on the inclusion of a gender perspective into their political programms' is to be completed in 2013 and 2014.","The main objectives of the NAP is to ‘promote the protection of women’s human rights, women in decision-making and the support that the Government will give Kosovo’s citizens, especially women and men who are victims of the war'.
There are also set 3 outcomes which all have individual outputs, activities and indicators assigned to them.  For example, Outcome 1, ‘Increased participation of women in decision making and peacekeeping and building processes’ has the following indicator:
Indicator 1a: percentage of women and girls in leadership and mangerial positions at central and local level.
Baseline: 13.1%
Target: 20%
The three outcomes are listed as the following:
Outcome 1: ‘‘Increased participation of women in decision making and peacekeeping and building processes’
Outcome 2: ‘Integrated gender perspectives in security affairs and increased women's participation in the security structures’
Outcome 3: ‘Survivors of sexual violence, torture, and other forms of violence associated with conflict/war have improved access to protection, access to justice, rehabilitation and reintegration.","For each of the three outcomes of the NAP, there are a separate set of indicators and individual outputs which have a set of activities and indicators as well as individual timeframes, implementation actors and budget estimation.
Pertaining to outcome 1, the first output (1.1) is on enhancing the capacities to implement UNSCR 1325 of national and local institutions in terms of gender mainstreaming in policy development and budgeting processes, there are several activities:
1.1.1. Carrying out research on women's participation in central and local institutions, in political parties and the gender responsiveness of policy development, implementation and budgeting
1.1.2 Training women and girls in political party forums and youth forums on the inclusion of a gender perspective into their political programs.","For each of the three outcomes of the NAP, there are a separate set of indicators and individual outputs which have a set of activities and indicators as well as individual timeframes, implementation actors and budget estimation.
The indicator for output (1.1) on enhancing the capacities to implement UNSCR 1325 of national and local institutions in terms of gender mainstreaming in policy development and budgeting processes, is listed as the following:
Number of draft policy documents with specific gender objectives and indicators
Baseline: 7 strategic documents have gender objectives
Target: all new drafts for government strategies and action plans have gender objectives and indicators","A  coordination and monitoring unit for the implementation of the NAP was set up by Deputy Prime Minister of Kosovo, Ms. Mimoza Kusari-Lila when the Agency for Gender Equality was defined as the institution responsible for monitoring the implementation. How the monitoring will take place is not concretely stated in the NAP.","The NAP will be budgeted based on the annual and medium-term Kosovo budget and the assistance plan from donors in and outside Kosovo while taking into consideration the priorities set in discussions of the working group.
The NAP is also described as a mechanism for fund raising which can increase the commitment of international donors and partners to promoting the issue of women, peace and security in Kosovo.
The NAP states the budget as having the total cost of 1.667.260 euros and uncommitted costs as 830.327 euros. Every output also has a specific budget listed as an estimate. For instance, the cost of the first output (1.1) is on enhancing the capacities to implement UNSCR 1325 of national and local institutions in terms of gender mainstreaming in policy development and budgeting processes, is estimated at 22.980 euros with committed costs being 9697 euros and uncommitted costs at 13373 euros. ",The Kosovo NAP does not include any language on disarmament or the links between militarisation and gender based violence.
Kyrgyzstan,"Kyrgyzstan adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) for the period 2022-2024. Analysis is forthcoming. The 2018-2020 NAP consists solely of an implementation matrix and does not provide an overview of the NAP development process or how the implementation of UNSCR 1325 fits into the country’s historical and political context. The NAP identifies three overarching objectives: strengthening the role and participation of women in activities aimed at preserving peace and security; strengthening the interaction between government, local governments and civil sciety in order to prevent conflicts and the risks of violence against women and girls, as well as measures to address the effects of crisis situations; and improving the system of protection and taking into account the special needs and requirements of women and girls in emergency situations. The NAP has an implementation matrix that breaks down each objective with corresponding tasks, measures/actions, indicators, responsible agency, terms of implementation, and form of implementation, but it does not have an allocated budget. Kyrgyzstan’s second NAP is preceded by one other NAP, adopted in 2013 and implemented for the period 2013-2014. Both plans consist solely of an implementation matrix without contextualizing the WPS agenda. While the first NAP identifies five overarching goals towards the implementation of Resolution 1325, the content of those goals remain similar across the two NAPs, focusing heavily on the protection of women and girls as well as increasing women’s participation in security and defense sectors. While neither NAP has an allocated budget, the second NAP states that government bodies and individual entities will be funding the identified activities. Kyrgyzstan reported on the implementation of its NAP in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country provided the following updates: The Osh City administration designed an Action Plan for the localization of the NAP and established a task force for its implementation (pg. 15). In 2019, the Forum of Women Parliamentarians of KR published a Roadmap on WPS (pg. 15). In November 2015, the Government approved the Action Plan on the Implementation of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325 on the Role of Women in Peacebuilding and Security for 2015-2017 (Government Order No. 560-p of 17 November 2015).” (pg. 59) Quantitative analysis of NAP 1325 2016-2017 outcomes attests to positive implementation dynamics. Specifically, 74 percent of planned activities were completed by the end of the NAP 1325 cycle (i.e., 25 out of 34 activities). When the third NAP 1325 was initiated, completion progress under NAP 1325 2016-2017 was 94 percent. (pg. 60) Following the 2nd NAP assessment, there were various factors identified that limited NAP implementation, including lack of financing, lack of state support, lack of awareness, weak coordination, lack of synchronization with other policies, and lack of alignment between indicators in the NAP and government work (pg. 60). The third NAP 1325 was approved by Government Order No. 334-p of 21 September 2018. The third NAP has neither an indicator matrix, nor estimates or budgets due to its specific format that does not allow for implementation instruments. (pg. 61) However, a Roadmap on the implementation of NAP 1325 was developed and adopted by the Forum of Women Deputies based on consultations with local self-government bodies and activists from seven regions of Kyrgyzstan. Kyrgyzstan gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Since then, the country has experienced political instability and ethnic tension as well as two major instances of civil unrest—the Tulip Revolution of 2005 and the Kyrgyz Revolution of 2010, which led to the ousting of the then presidents Askar Akayev and Kurmanbek Bakiyev, respectively. In 2010, the growing unrest resulted in an interethnic conflict between the majority Kyrgyz and minority Uzbeks, leaving over 400 casualties and hundreds of wounded. The conflict has had distinct gendered impacts , with women subjected to sexual violence, humiliation, and extortion as well as experiencing social stigma as survivors of sexual violence.",1997,93,,124M,"The analysis in these tabs corresponds to the 2018-2020 NAP.
NAP Development
The NAP does not provide information about the development process of the NAP. 
WILPF does not have a country section in Kyrgyzstan and therefore was not involved in the development process of Kyrgyzstan’s NAP.
NAP Implementation
The NAP indicates that ministries, state committees, administrative departments, local state administrations, and local governments are to “take measures to implement the action plan with participation of representatives of civil society, international and non-profit organizations.” However, the NAP does not further specify details about civil society inclusion in the implementation of the action plan. 
The NAP tasks several ministries and state commissions with the implementation of the plan. These government actors include Ministries of Health; Interior; Emergency Situations; and Education as well as the State Committee of National Security, among others. The NAP also lists local governments and an inter-agency working group among the actors responsible for implementing select objectives of the NAP. 
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
The NAP does not indicate civil society inclusion in the monitoring and evaluation of the NAP.
The NAP does not specify a specific government actor responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of the NAP. Instead, it states that “control over the implementation of this decree shall be entrusted to the Department of Defense, Law Enforcement and Emergency Situations of the Office of Prime Minister of the Kyrgyz Republic.” (p.2)","The NAP does not specify a timeframe for the implementation of the action plan; however, the implementation matrix sets the timeframe for identified activities as 2018-2020.","The NAP identifies three main objectives: 
Strengthening the role and participation of women, including at decision-making level, in activities aimed at preserving peace and security;
Strengthening the interaction of government, local governments and civil society in order to prevent conflicts and the risks of violence against women and girls, as well as measures to address the effects of crisis situations;
Improving the system of protection and taking into account the special needs and requirements of women and girls in emergency situations.",,"The NAP identifies an indicator for each objective as well as the objective’s corresponding tasks and measures/actions. For example, objective #1, “Strengthening the role and participation of women, including at decision-making level, in activities aimed at preserving peace and security,” lists “number of special measures inserted in government bodies” as an indicator. This objective’s first task, “increasing women's representation in local council and local government bodies” lists “number of trained women” as an indicator.","The NAP does not include a monitoring and evaluation plan. However, the preface to the implementation matrix identifies two benchmarks for tracking progress: 1) Based on the results of the first half year, ministries, state committees, administrative departments, local state administrations, and local governments will provide a progress report to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and 2) Following the results of each half year, the Ministry of Internal Affairs will submit a final report to the Office of Government.","The NAP does not contain an allocated or estimated budget. However, the preface to the implementation matrix states that ministries, state committees, administrative departments, local state administrations, and local governments are to “finance the activities of the action plan at the expense of funds provided for by the government bodies and local authorities involved in its implementation, according to the laws of the Kyrgyz Republic ‘On the state budget of the Kyrgyz Republic for 2018 and the forecast for 2019-2020,’ as well as other sources not prohibited by law of Kyrgyz Republic.”",The NAP does not address disarmament or demilitarization.
Latvia,"Latvia adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2020 for the period 2020-2025. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in collaboration with the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Education and Science, Ministry of Welfare, and Ministry of Health. The various ministries also consulted with non-governmental organizations, civil society and academia to develop the NAP. The NAP highlights the interrelated nature of gender equality and peace and security and identifies the promotion of UNSCR 1325 in public administration and Latvian society as a principal objective. To further this objective, the NAP states identifies three main tasks: raising public awareness of gender equality issues and the elimination of gender-based violence, especially in the younger generation; training for the defence and internal affairs sector, including the establishment of a gender adviser position; and transfer of Latvia’s experience and knowledge. In addition to a brief implementation and monitoring and evaluation plan, the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also has a communications plan to raise public awareness of the NAP and WPS agenda at large through well-known ambassadors in the field. The NAP does not have an allocated budget, but provides a detailed timeline to implement the various tasks identified. Latvia gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Latvia does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but is a member of NATO and has participated in overseas military operations and peacekeeping missions. Latvia has been experiencing ongoing tension with Russia as a result of the latter’s military activities, including placement of troops and ballistic missiles, in the Baltic Sea Region. Between 2010 and 2019, Latvia increased its military spending by 176 percent.",1992,11,2014,710M,"NAP Development

The three lines of actions have various deadlines for the respective events/actions mentioned.,"The main aim of the NAP is to “develop and improve coordinated actions for the maintenance of peace and security at the international and national levels taking into account the principles of gender equality”. The NAP mentions the following sub-objectives to be implemented: 
Purposeful and coordinated activities in the implementation of the Women, Peace and Security agenda in international organizations and formats. 
Raising public awareness of Women, Peace and Security and reducing gender-based violence. 
Educating the new generation and raising awareness of gender equality and the prevention of gender-based violence. 
Capacity building of the Defence and Internal Affairs sector on gender issues. 
Promoting the exchange of knowledge and experience on the UNSC Resolution in the framework of bilateral and multilateral development cooperation","The NAP lists three main tasks/activities to be implemented: (1) raising public awareness of gender equality issues and the elimination of gender-based violence, especially in the younger generation; (2) training for the Defence and Internal Affairs sector, including the establishment of a gender adviser’s position; and (3) transfer of Latvia’s experience and knowledge.

Lebanon 2,"Lebanon adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2019 for the period 2019-2022. The NAP was developed by a steering committee, spearheaded by the National Commission for Lebanese Women (NCLW), which was composed of six government ministries, three civil society organizations, and six UN agencies serving as a technical advisory board. The NAP highlights a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach in implementing the identified objectives, and emphasizes that the NAP should be “viewed as a living document that can be reviewed and revised by responsible national institutions as they see fit” (p. 18). The objectives of the NAP reflect the pillars of UNSCR 1325, with specific focus on increasing women’s full participation in decision-making processes in the political, diplomatic, and economic domain as well as in the security and defense sectors. As such, the NAP contextualizes the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) Agenda by grounding the discussion in Lebanon’s national legal and strategic frameworks and persisting challenges of advancing women’s rights in the personal, political, and legal realms. The NAP also connects these discussions to the international human rights framework as well as promoting an integrated agenda by linking WPS actions to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular Goal 5 on reducing gender inequality and Goal 16 on promoting peaceful and inclusive societies. Additionally, the NAP includes an allocated budget. The most recent conflict in Lebanon’s history is the Lebanese Civil War, which lasted from 1975 until 1990, leaving over 100,000 casualties and an estimated 17,000 people missing or disappeared. In 1991, the Lebanese government issued an amnesty law, pardoning all crimes committed during the war. Nevertheless, as a result of the growing pressure from the families of those who were disappeared, the government passed a landmark law in 2018 to establish an independent national commission to investigate the disappearances. On the international front, dissolving the final remnants of the war, Israel and Syria withdrew from Lebanon in 2000 and 2005, respectively. However, the escalating tensions between Lebanon and Israel led to a 34-day conflict in 2006, thus resulting in the expansion of the UNIFIL mandate to prevent hostilities. In the past decade, Lebanon has also been grappling with the spillover effects of the Syrian Civil War, and currently hosts 1.5 million Syrian refugees. Most recently, between 2019 and 2020, Lebanon experienced a series of political protests in which women played a key role to demand an end to social, political, and economic inequalities that stand as the remnants of the civil war.",1997,145,2014,2.5B,"NAP Development
The NAP was developed by a steering committee, spearheaded by the National Commission for Lebanese Women (NCLW), which comprised six government ministries, three civil society organizations, and six UN agencies serving as a technical advisory board. The civil society organizations consisted of ABAAD-Resource Center for Gender Equality, Women In Front, and the Institute for Arab Women at the Lebanese American University. Additionally, six sectoral meetings with ministries, key national institutions, and civil society organizations were held to further develop the NAP. 
NAP Implementation
The NAP indicates that the NAP’s implementation “requires close coordination between ministries and other national institutions, civil society, United Nations agencies and other international organizations.” However, the NAP does not specify how or which civil society organizations will be included in the implementation process.  
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
The NAP does not indicate civil society inclusion in the monitoring and evaluation of the NAP. ",The implementation period of the NAP is between 2019-2022.,"The NAP identifies five objectives (referred to as “strategic priorities”), compiled under the four pillars of UNSCR 1325. These objectives are: 
Participation in decision-making at all levels
Prevention of conflict
Prevention of and protection of women and girls from gender-based violence
Relief and recovery
Normative framework
Each strategic priority has corresponding goals. For example, the goal for Strategic Priority II: Prevention of Conflict is, “The Government of Lebanon shall take strides to ensure that women play an active role in the prevention of conflict and in decreasing tensions at the national and local levels. It shall also promote women’s roles in preventing violent extremism and in the implementation of early warning response mechanisms” (p. 18).  ","The NAP has a detailed implementation matrix that breaks down each objective with corresponding outcomes, outputs, interventions, indicators, potential responsible institution(s), timeline, and estimated financial resources. Actions and activities are specified under the outcomes, outputs, and interventions subsections, with each subsection providing a more specific plan of implementation. For example, Strategic Priority II: Prevention of Conflict has the following action schema:
Outcome 1: Dialogue and trust are fostered to prevent the outbreak of conflict and women participate in decision-making processes and responses related to conflict prevention.
Output 1.1: The awareness and capacities of concerned stakeholders on women’s roles in peace-building and conflict resolution are increased.
Intervention 1.1: Develop a gender sensitive curriculum on peace education and human and women’s rights in universities and schools (including in schools with displaced/refugee populations, prisons, juvenile reform centers, scouts and youth centers).","The NAP identifies several indicators, both qualitative and quantitative, for each objective, outlined in the implementation matrix. For example, Outcome 1 listed under Strategic Priority II: Prevention of Conflict identifies, “Extent of increase in the level of confidence on prevention of conflict among the public” and “Extent of increase of women’s participation in decision-making processes associated with conflict resolutions at the national level” as indicators (p. 39, implementation matrix). ","The NAP indicates that the implementation matrix, and the specific indicators listed on it, will serve as a framework for monitoring and reporting on implementation efforts. Additionally, a national baseline study will be conducted during the first year of implementation. There will also be a final evaluation during the last year of implementation.    ","The subtotal cost for the implementation of the NAP is USD 13,699,640/LBP 20,549,460,000 over four years. The NAP indicates that ten percent of the subtotal has been allocated to a baseline study (3%), yearly monitoring (years 2 and 3 (4%)), and final evaluation (2%), bringing the total cost of the NAP to USD 15,069,616/LBP 22,604,424,000. In addition to including an overall budget, the NAP also has an allocated budget for each strategic priority. ",The NAP does not mention disarmament in any of its objectives or scope of implementation.
Liberia,"Liberia adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2019 for the period 2019-2023. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection through a participatory approach that included consultations with key line ministries, agencies and commissions, civil society organizations, women’s groups, youth groups, media, and international partners. The NAP is constructed on five main pillars, reflective of the key pillars of UNSCR 1325: prevention, protection, participation, relief and recovery, and coordination and accountability. Each of these pillars have dedicated outcomes, outputs, indicators and activities, which support the following goals: women and girls’ safety, physical and mental health and security are assured and are fully protected under legislation and policies that promote their empowerment and full participation at all levels, in building sustainable and inclusive peace and security in Liberia. The NAP includes a detailed monitoring and implementation plan as well as an allocated budget. Liberia’s second NAP is preceded by one other NAP, adopted in 2009 and implemented for the period 2009-2013. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Gender and Development in consultation with civil society actors. The NAP’s objectives are compiled under four thematic pillars: protection; prevention; participation and empowerment; and promotion. Each pillar has corresponding strategic issues, priority areas, outputs, and indicators; nevertheless, these actions do not have allocated funds. Liberia’s second NAP follows a similar thematic structure, compiling the overall objectives under five pillars: prevention; protection; participation; relief and recovery; and coordination and accountability. The NAP also includes a standalone section on lessons learned from the implementation of the first NAP and provides a more substantive engagement with contextualizing the WPS agenda within the historical and political framework of Liberia. The second NAP’s monitoring and evaluation mechanism is more detailed as well, specifically through the inclusion of timeframes and an allocated budget for each outlined activity. Liberia reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country provided the following updates, among others: With a goal of ‘a more peaceful, unified society that enables economic transformation and sustainable development’, the Government of Liberia is committed to compliance with human rights obligations as per treaties acceded. It has set national targets in the Social Cohesion and Reconciliation (SCORE)6 index to increase civic trust and co- existence from 52% to 70% and to reduce the index for violent tendencies from 19% to 5%. (p. 12) The Peace Hut initiative was established after the civil war and during the first term of former President H.E Madam Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, providing a safe space for women in rural communities to discuss issues that plague them especially relating to conflict resolution. There are over 36 Peace Huts established across the country … At the Peace Huts women mediate problems, run projects and businesses, and advocate for women’s rights. (p. 39) The Ministry of Gender Children and Social Protection with support from UN Women, provided training for 47 female candidates in campaign strategies; message development, mapping, debating and public speaking. Also, 25 women were trained from September 25-28, 2017 in Gbarnga, Bong County, to serve as election observers in 25 selected districts across the country. The training was in collaboration with the Women Peace and Security Institute, with funding from Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Center. As an outcome of the Colloquium, a Leadership building platform through Mentorship was established for young women and youth. In this light the Ministry will be training 30 young leaders in leadership skills under the Theme: Unleashing the Leadership in Young Women and Youth. Currently, women comprise 12.3% in the House of Representatives and make up 10.0% in the Senate. The Government of Liberia, as a High National Level Target in the PAPD (2018-2023), has committed to increasing the political participation of women at the national and local levels to reach a target of 30% by 2023. In addition, prior to the passage of the Liberian Local Government Act in 2018, the Government implemented the Liberia Decentralization Support Program which provided training for women and girls leadership to participate in local governance. The Local Government Act is also gender sensitive as it exclusively provides 2 out of 7 members local assembly seats for women. In turn, women can compete for the remaining 5 seats. (p. 75) The most recent armed conflict in Liberia’s history was the two civil wars, which took place from 1989-1997 and 1999-2003. The United Nations Mission in Liberia ( UNMIL ) was established in 2003 to support the implementation of the ceasefire and peace process, and departed in 2018, after 15 years in the country. Women have played a key role in Liberia’s peace and reconciliation efforts, in particular through the establishment of the Women of Liberia Mass Action for Peace. Women’s active campaigning led to the signing of the Accra Peace Agreement in 2003. While women were excluded from mediator and signatory roles, they represented 17% of witnesses. Additionally, the agreement had multiple provisions addressing women’s rights.",1984,97,2015,17M,"NAP Development
Civil society organizations (CSOs) were involved in the NAP development process, in particular, they participated in the following consultations: 1) Two awareness-raising workshops in May 2019 to raise awareness about UNSCR 1325 and promote leadership, ownership and participation of local communities; 2) Two-day monitoring and evaluation (M&E) workshop in May 2019 to review the NAP logical framework, implementing structure and cost activities.
Additionally, civil society members were also part of the 1325 working group that developed the new implementation structure for the NAP. 
The lead agent in the development of Liberia’s NAP was the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection (MGCSP). However, representatives of the Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Youth and Sports also participated in the NAP development process.
NAP Implementation 
The implementation structure (pg 23) presents the various interlinked implementing bodies and lays out their roles and responsibilities (annex, pg 48 onwards). The National Steering Committee (NSC), Technical Working Group (TWG), Monitoring and Evaluation Learning Unit (M& EL Unit), County Task Forces, and District Champions, are responsible for implementing the NAP at various levels and have civil society and women’s groups representatives as their members. 
Government Ministries and Agencies are involved in all the NAP’s implementation and coordination structure. All implementing bodies will report to the President of Liberia. For instance, the National Steering Committee (NSC) will be  “co-chaired by the Minister of the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection (MGCSP), the Minister of Justice (MoJ) and Minister of Defence (MoD)” (pg 48). The Technical Working Group (TWG) will be “co-chaired by the Deputy Minister of the Department of Gender at the Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection and the Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning”. The TWG also has “Gender focal points of each government Ministry involved in LNAP WPS implementation” (pg 50). 
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
Civil society members are part of the NAP’s M&EL Unit, which plays a crucial role in the development of a detailed M & EL plan (pg 24). In the overall Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting Framework of the NAP, CSOs are represented at the district, county, TWG and NSC levels.
The M&EL Unit primarily responsible for the NAP’s M & E will be co-chaired by senior representatives of the MGCSP’s M&E Unit and a senior representative of the Liberia Institute of Statistics Geo-Information Services (pg 51). The unit will also have M & E focal points from all ministries, representatives from the Governance Commission and the Liberia Institute of Statistics and Geo-Information Services.","The NAP is implemented from 2019 to 2023. It is expected to undergo a mid-term (December 2021) review and final evaluation (December 2023). Under each pillar of the NAP, the respective outcomes and indicators mention a particular timeline to achieve targets and activities. 
For instance, In pillar 1 of the NAP i.e, Prevention, under the output “Legal and constitutional reforms to promote security of women, young women and girls enacted” one of the targets is to train 200 legislators, 200 government officials and 50 members from parliamentary committees, staff from the legislative drafting bureau “to develop, amend and implement legislation and policies in line with gender and human rights standards disaggregated by age, sex and region” (pg 26) by 2023. ","The Liberian NAP is constructed on five pillars: Prevention, Protection, Participation, Relief and recovery, and coordination and accountability. These pillars address the government’s priority regarding WPS agenda and are aligned with “national policies and strategies, namely the PAPD, the revised National Action Plan on GBV (NAPGBV) 2018-2023, and the NGP (2018-2022) amongst others.”
For example: Pillar 3 i.e., Participation has the following outcomes and outputs (pg 36). 
Outcome 3: Effective participation and leadership of women, young women, disabled and rural women at all levels of decision-making in peacebuilding, peacekeeping, conflict management and resolution and countering terrorism
Output 3.1: Implementation of measures to ensure women’s, young women’s and girls’ political participation and leadership in elections, political parties, constitutional and legislative processes
Output 3.2.: Laws and strategies regulating SSIs and the extent to which they promote participation and leadership of women and young women in these institutions are reviewed and appropriate actions taken
Output 3.3.: Women’s and young women’s participation and leadership in SSIs including armed forces, police forces and UN peacekeeping forces, promoted.
Output 3.4.: Women’s inclusion and participation in the justice sector, including the legislature and judiciary, promoted
Output 3.5.: Strengthened ability of women and young women leaders, women’s rights advocates, and CSO representatives to foster women’s leadership roles in peacekeeping and peacebuilding efforts, mediation and negotiations and countering terrorism
Output 3.6.: Greater participation of women, young women, disabled and rural women in peacebuilding and conflict management and resolution processes, including national dialogues and transitional justice","Under each pillar, the NAP lists activities that will be implemented to achieve its overall goal, these activities will be mainly conducted through line ministries as part of their ongoing plans. 
For instance, In pillar 4. Relief and recovery, to strengthen integration of gender perspectives into relief, recovery and peacebuilding intervention, following were the activities stated (pg 41): 
National Disaster Management Agency of Liberia (NDMA) to integrate gender analysis into all post-disaster planning tools and processes; ensure recovery efforts provide equal economic opportunities for women including access to assets, such as land and credit; promote social protection, and sustainable livelihoods, prioritize women’s needs in key sectors such as transportation, shelter and health care, during and after disasters. 
NDMA to incorporate gender analysis in the assessment of disaster risks, impacts and needs; address women’s unique needs and value women’s knowledge in disaster reduction and recovery policies, plans and programmes; strengthen women’s networks and organizations to facilitate women’s active engagement. 
NDMA to provide capacity building for all relevant actors to mainstream gender in all Humanitarian/crisis response planning, frameworks and programming
In addition to indicating the activities for each output and indicator, the NAP also lists the budget, timeline and responsible parties that will carry out these activities.","Each pillar of the Liberian NAP has a set of outcomes, outputs and indicators dedicated to it.  
For example, under Pillar 5: Coordination and accountability, to increase coordination, implementation, reporting and accountability on Liberia’s second NAP (pg 44), indicators are: 
Liberia’s second phase NAP endorsed by the MGCSP and all other responsible parties and implemented
Annual Report on NAP implementation presented by President to the legislature","The NAP Monitoring and Evaluation Learning Unit (M&EL Unit) plays a crucial role in developing a detailed  M&EL plan and is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the overall implementation of the NAP.  At the national level the M&EL Unit reports annually to the President and Legislature. At the county level, the NAP county task forces report to the M&EL unit and they track and record progress of NAP activities at county level. At the district level, the district task force reports to the county task force and tracks and records progress of NAP activities from clans, chiefdoms, DAC officers and Town Advisory Councils. ","The NAP estimates the costs to carry out activities under the five pillars. For instance, in pillar 2 of the NAP i.e. Protection, the Ministry of Health and Social Services is responsible for providing “necessary equipment and training for all MCH facility staff on GBV protocol for addressing health care needs (especially MCH needs) of survivors of SGBV”, which is estimated to cost USD 200,000 for 2020 to 2023 (pg 33).  
“The NAP was costed using a genderresponsive budgeting (GRB) approach, as part of a two-day workshop that reviewed the NAP logical framework, including baseline, targets, data sources, responsible institutions and timeline information. Participants included government, CSOs, women’s groups, youth groups and media professionals” (pg 25). 
Note on Liberia’s first NAP budget: “No government funding was dedicated to NAP implementation and international funds were committed to support the Ministry of Gender and Development (MoGD) and coordination, but not to support activities. The lack of resources led to insufficiently trained staff and activities left incomplete or never started at all.”",The NAP does not refer to or address disarmament issues and arms proliferation as a risk to the national implementation of the UNSCR 1325.
Lithuania,"Lithuania adopted its second National Action Plan (NAP) in 2020, for the period 2020-2024.​​ According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Lithuania , the 2020-2024 NAP “aims to strengthen women’s role in the building of peace and to promote their participation in security and democratic processes at the national and international levels”, taking into account prior implementation of WPS at the national and regional levels. The development of the NAP considered the experience gained over twenty years of the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325, the conclusions of the Council of the European Union (EU) on Women, Peace and Security, and the provisions of the EU Action Plan regarding the Women, Peace and Security Agenda 2019-2024.  It contains objectives, targets, activities, expected results and an allocated budget. It will be implemented by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of National Defence, the Ministry of the Interior, the Ministry of Social Security and Labour, the Ministry of Health, and the Police Department under the Ministry of the Interior, and will be monitored by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Lithuania adopted its first NAP in 2011, which identified three overarching objectives: increase the participation of women in conflict prevention as well as military and civilian operations and missions; raise awareness about UNSCR 1325 among Lithunian society and educate the personnel of pertinent institutions; contribute to international initiatives to implement UNSCR 1325, specifically on women’s security and protection of women’s rights. Lithuania reported on the implementation of its NAP in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). The 2020 NAP approaches the implementation of Women, Peace and Security and gender equality at both the domestic and international levels.  It changes the focus of national action somewhat from 2015, encompassed by four overarching goals: to promote women’s leadership in international peace processes; to promote gender equality; to intensify international cooperation for the Agenda issues; to advise state institutions, non-governmental organizations on the issues of the Agenda, to raise public awareness. Each objective has corresponding goals, actions, responsible actors, a broad implementation timetable and allocated budget. The 2020 NAP does not have a monitoring and evaluation framework specified. Lithuania gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1990. The country does not have a recent history of armed conflict; nevertheless, Lithuania has been experiencing ongoing tension with Russia as a result of the latter’s military activities, including placement of troops and ballistic missiles, in the Baltic Sea Region.  Between 2010 and 2019, Lithuania increased its military spending by 232 percent. Lithuania is also a contributor to humanitarian aid, including being a contributing donor to the Women’s Peace and Humanitarian Fund , a global partnership that works to empower women in conflict zones and humanitarian crises. At the multilateral level, Lithuania most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2014-2015.",1994,33,2014,1.084B,"NAP Development
The 2020-2024 NAP was developed by Lithuania’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  
The NAP does not specify civil society involvement during the development process.
NAP Implementation
The NAP will be implemented by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the Ministry of National Defence; the Ministry of the Interior; the Ministry of Social Security and Labour; the Ministry of Health (Institute of Hygiene); and the Police Department under the Ministry of the Interior.
NAP monitoring and evaluation
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will monitor the implementation of the NAP. ",The implementation period for Lithuania’s NAP is five years (2020-2024).,"The NAP is organized into four overarching goals (called tasks) (p. 8)
 Promote women leadership in international peace processes: this task addresses the inclusion of women in peace operations and missions, in institutions, and as diplomats and peace mediators
To promote gender equality: this task includes increasing knowledge of mechanisms that prevent, combat and handle violence, sexual exploitation, abuse, and gender-based harassment and violence, including institution staff and soldiers; also preparing a report on Availability of Healthcare for Women and Girls who Have Experienced Domestic Violence. 
To intensify international cooperation for the issues of the Agenda: this task includes agenda-setting within the OSCE, EU, NATO and other high-ranking multilateral meetings, knowledge-sharing and attending expert meetings on the WPS agenda.
To advise state institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) on the issues of the Agenda, to raise public awareness: this task includes agenda-setting for trainings for EU missions, international operations, diplomatic missions etc.; training civil servants and soldiers; researching the role of gender in different socioeconomic environments during conflict; supporting NGOs with WPS competence and dissemination of information.","The NAP breaks each of the four overarching tasks into specific actions, called measures, along with the period of implementation in years (p. 3-9).
 For example, task 2 of ‘To promote gender equality’ encompasses four measures including:
‘To evaluate the possibility of appointing gender advisers in the Ministry of National Defence and/or other institutions of the national defence system and, if possible, establishing positions for gender advisers in these institutions’ (p. 4)’
Timeline: 2020-2024
‘To inform soldiers and staff at national defence institutions on how to contribute to the fight against all forms of violence against women, including sexual exploitation, violence, and harassment, especially in the event of a crisis, threat, or conflict.’ (p. 5)
Timeline: 2020-2024","Each measure set out under the broader tasks has an indicator of implementation called ‘Results to be achieved’.  They are broad, and mostly qualitative indicators.  The relevant implementing authorities are also included (p. 3-9).
For example, Task 1 of ‘Promote women leadership in international peace processes’ includes measure ‘1.5. To train and consult potential peace mediators on Agenda topics and to strengthen their skills’.  
Result to be achieved: ‘At least 3 potential peace mediators trained’ (p. 4)
Implementing authorities: the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  ","Although the NAP indicates that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will monitor its implementation, no framework for monitoring and evaluation was included, nor was an action or measure to formulate one.","The NAP stipulates that “The Action Plan shall be implemented with the appropriations from the state budget of the Republic of Lithuania allocated to the responsible executors” (p. 1).  The measures are allocated an appropriation (in EUR) per year per executor, as necessary.  For instance, under Task 1 “Promote women leadership in international peace processes”, the measure “1.4 To make a list of potential peace mediators” has no budget allocated.  Measure ‘4.4 Depending on the authority, to help non-governmental organizations develop competence on Agenda issues, to disseminate information, and to promote participation in international forums’ has an appropriation of €1000 per year each for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Social Security and Labour.",Lithuania's NAP does not address disarmament nor the gendered impacts of weapons such as small arms.
Luxembourg,"Luxembourg adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2018 for the period 2018-2023. The NAP was developed by Luxembourg’s Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs, with input from civil society. Luxembourg’s NAP is a continuation of and reflects the commitments of the country’s National Action Plan on Gender Equality, which was implemented during the 2015-2018 period. The NAP is organized around the four pillars of UNSCR 1325 (participation, prevention, protection, and resolution and recovery), and identifies gender equality as a “prerequisite” for peace and security as well as an “essential condition” for sustainable development. Additionally, the NAP indicates that Luxembourg’s action plan is directly linked to the 2030 Agenda, with particular emphasis on SDGs 5 and 16 on gender equality and peace and justice, respectively. The NAP approaches WPS implementation both domestically and internationally. While the NAP does not address disarmament, it does touch upon the gendered socioeconomic impacts of cluster munitions and anti-personnel mines. Additionally, the NAP has an implementation matrix, but does not include an allocated budget. Luxembourg does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but was a founding member of NATO. The country is also a contributing member to Eurocorps , a multinational and intergovernmental military corps, which remains at the disposal of the EU and NATO. Luxembourg is among the few countries to have legislation banning public and private financial institutions from investing in cluster munitions. Nevertheless, a 2016 report demonstrated that Luxembourg has significant gaps in its banking regulations to prohibit banks from financing and investing in the production and transfer of internationally banned weapons or arms. At the multilateral level, Luxembourg most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2013-2014.",1989,51,2014,429M,"NAP Development

The NAP indicates that civil society will be involved in monitoring the implementation of the NAP. However, the document does not specify which civil society organizations will be represented or how they will contribute to the implementation of the NAP. 
The Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the NAP, and will evaluate it on an annual basis. The Ministry will also send an interim implementation report to the Government Council in preparation for developing the next action plan.",The implementation period of the NAP is five years (2018-2023).,"The NAP identifies four overarching objectives, compiled under the slightly modified four pillars of UNSCR 1325: participation; prevention; protection, relief, and recovery; and promotion. These objectives are listed below:
Participation: Promote the equal participation of women and men at all levels of peace and security processes, and support women's participation in decision-making.
Prevention: Strengthening peace and security in line with UNSCR 1325; preventing sexual and gender-based violence.
Protection, Relief, and Recovery: Strengthening gender-based violence training for Luxembourg staff; implement such training for local forces in peacekeeping operations; strengthening access to justice and redress.
Promotion: Promoting the women and peace and security agenda at the national and international levels.","The NAP has an implementation matrix that breaks down each overarching objective with corresponding specific objectives, actions, indicators, and ministries and departments involved. For example, the overarching category of prevention has “Commit to eliminate cluster munitions and anti-personnel mines” as a specific objective. This objective lists, “Continue efforts within the framework of the convention on cluster munitions and the Convention on anti-personnel mines, emphasizing the effects of these weapons on women; mine clearance projects” as an action item (p. 29).  ","The NAP identifies several indicators for each objective, outlined in the implementation matrix. For example, the objective, “Commit to eliminate cluster munitions and anti-personnel mines” lists “Interventions made; funds allocated” as an indicator (p. 29). ","The Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the NAP, and will evaluate it on an annual basis.

For the development of the plan, the Office of the President, Ministry of Gender, Community Development and Social Welfare, and UN Women convened in several meetings to scope out the process. NAPs from selected countries in the Africa Region were reviewed to draw lessons from them. Four stakeholders’ consultative workshops were held in the Northern, Central, Eastern and Southern regions to develop goal, objectives and priority areas and key interventions. Consultative workshops were held in five districts known for conflicts which were purposefully selected to get perspectives of the refugees, asylum seekers, and others. 
The actors in charge of the process of development of the NAP are the Ministry of Gender, Community Development and Social Welfare, Cooperating Partners, local and international NGOs, the Office of the President, and the Cabinet. This task force was developed with the objective to speed the process towards implementing the Action Plan and to enhance realization of Women, Peace and Security on all levels. The National Task Force harnessed technical and thematic expertise from various stakeholders involved in peace and security policies and initiatives throughout the country, in alignment with the National Peace Architecture (NPA). For the development of the plan, the Office of the President, Ministry of Gender, Community Development and Social Welfare, UN Women convened in several meetings to scope out the process. In this process, NAPs from selected countries in the Africa Region were reviewed to draw lessons from them.

Consultative workshops were held in five districts which were purposefully selected to incorporate the perspectives of the refugees, asylum seekers, and others. 
Implementation 
The Ministry of Gender, Community Development and Social Welfare is the institution responsible for the promotion of gender equality in national development and the empowerment of women in Malawi. This Ministry provides overall coordination of the NAP. It will work in collaboration with the Malawi Peace Commission, the Ministry responsible for Civic Education and National Unity. In addition, there will be an independent national coordinating body to ensure the implementation of the NAP.
Monitoring and Evaluation 
For monitoring and evaluation, Malawi appointed the Ministry of Gender, Community Development and Social Welfare as well as the Malawi Peace Commission to coordinate the implementation of the NAP. A national coordinating body also is involved in the process of ensuring collaborative engagements between these entities and follow up on the implementation. ",The timeframe of the NAP is 2021-2025.,"Malawi has formulated its NAP around three strategic areas: an integrated response to violence against women and girls, promotion of economic empowerment, and strengthening of the enabling environment for the effective and sustainable implementation of global commitments on WPS at the national level. The NAP is intended to stimulate focused interventions from various stakeholders and interest groups. Malawi seeks to materialize UNSCR 1325 initiatives at the country level with the support of continental and global efforts on WPS.
The NAP also has six general objectives:
Enhance accountability and implementation of international and national frameworks on Women, Peace and Security 
Mainstream gender in Women, Peace and Security structures, strategies and processes
Capacitate state and non-state institutions at all levels to enable them to advance WPS agenda effectively
Increase the participation of women and girls in decision-making structures in peacebuilding processes 
Prevent and effectively respond to violence against women and girls
Protect women and girls in conflict and non-conflict and humanitarian situations.","The NAP outlines a range of actions, which include:
Put in place interventions and measures for increased women’s and girls’ participation at all levels of decision-making in conflict management and peace interventions, including participation in various institutions and platforms at national, regional and international level. 
Create and support platforms that carry out interventions and provide services for the protection of women and girls from sexual violence, sexual exploitation and abuse, and gender-based violence in conflict, refugee camps and other disaster and humanitarian contexts. 
Ensure relief and recovery measures and other humanitarian crises are addressed through gendered lens, while taking deliberate account of the needs of women and girls when designing programmes and settlements for displaced persons during the time of disasters and other humanitarian crises. 
Support the implementation of Gender Related Laws to ensure increased participation 
Train women in district peace committees on WPS and leadership 
Mobilize women and girls and support their adult literacy and numeracy education to enable them to participate in decision-making platforms
Support the implementation of Gender Related Laws to enhance protection of women and girls 
Strengthen mechanisms that facilitate provision of psychosocial support to victims of disasters and conflict situations","The NAP details the goals and actions for each of the pillars that serve as the foundation of the Project Document, and there is information about the key expected results of each activity. Further, the NAP situates itself within an analysis of the current state of implementation of WPS within Malawi, and indicates which key elements are present or not present within the country's national policies and programming, as indicators for the current level of WPS mainstreaming. ","There will be a monitoring and evaluation plan in place for data collection and reporting on the project indicators. The data will include national surveys, and progress reports submitted by institutions and organizations that implement some of the NAP activities. There will be quarterly and annual reports, as well as a mid-term review of the NAP.","The NAP has an implementation plan which includes an overall budget for each of the key interventions regarding the priority area or pillar it belongs to. For example, a key intervention is to implement Gender related laws to ensure increased women’s participation. This priority area is accompanied by other key activities and for this section, the nation has allocated USD 1,352,000.

Mali,"Mali adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2019 for the period 2019-2023. The NAP’s theory of change (pgs. 22-23) centers women’s participation in peacebuilding, reconciliation processes, and in post-conflict governance and identifies concrete outcomes and associated actions. Mali’s third NAP builds on lessons learned from the previous plan, consultations at all levels, and research on Women, Peace and Security agenda implementation. It has a number of key changes from the previous plan (pgs. 20-21), which include: Updated contextual analysis; Alignment with international, regional, and national instruments; Two results frameworks (a strategic framework and an operational plan); Longer duration; Ownership and broad leadership; Improved coordination, monitoring, and budgetary mechanism; and Localization. The 2019-2023 NAP includes emerging issues including radicalization and violent extremism; displacement; the role of men in advancing gender equality, and climate change. The NAP contains a situational analysis of the previous NAPs, and reports on progress from the 2015-2017 NAP in order to provide context for the new plan. The NAP includes an operational plan, and notes that details are subject to change; the NAP will be updated yearly and as required (pg. 6). There is a national budget for implementation, which is supplemented by another fund to finance stakeholder implementation. Mali’s third NAP is preceded by two other NAPs, adopted in 2012 and 2015 and implemented for the period 2012-2014 and 2015-2017, respectively. Mali reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, Mali indicated that the priorities of the third NAP include: the prevention of conflicts and gender-based violence, protection and rehabilitation of victims, participation and representation of women in decision-making bodies, promotion of gender and women’s empowerment, and coordination, monitoring, and evaluation (p. 35). Additionally, Mali reported that there is low representation of women in the monitoring of the peace, security and reconciliation process. The average representation of women in the implementation mechanisms of the peace agreement is around 3% (p. 33). Mali gained independence from France in 1960, after decades of colonial rule by the French Empire. Mali has experienced ongoing political instability since its independence, with multiple military coups in 1968, 1991, 2012, and 2020, including extended rule by a military junta from 1969 until 1979. Furthermore, Mali experienced two armed conflicts with Burkina Faso, resulting from a recurring border dispute in 1974-1975 and 1985. Most recently, in 2012, Mali experienced conflict with Islamic and Tuareg insurgent groups, leading to instability in the northern parts of the country. A UN peacekeeping mission, MINUSMA, has been active in Mali since 2013.

Implementation will also include representatives from 15 ministries, the National Assembly, government programs, CSOs, the UN, technical and financial partners, and the implementation mechanisms of the Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation. The list of members of the National Monitoring Committee is available on pg. 25. It will meet every quarter to discuss results and progress on the NAP. The Support Steering Committee is responsible for resource mobilization (pg. 24), and the Technical Management Unit is responsible for coordination, communication, monitoring and evaluation, and management of dedicated resources.
The NAP states that consultations with civil society were organized as part of NAP development, and that a Community of Practice will be maintained for the purpose of learning and implementation. There is a NAP indicator for civil society’s level of participation in the process.",The timeframe for NAP implementation is 2019-2023.,"The overall goal of the NAP is to incorporate gender into legislative, institutional, and structural reforms, focusing on women’s participation in peacebuilding and reconciliation processes and in post-conflict governance (pg. 7). 
There are four main priorities in the NAP:
Participation: Women are fairly and actively involved in peacebuilding and reconciliation processes, and hold decision-making positions at all levels of governance.
Prevention: Sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) arising during conflicts are prevented and women make a significant contribution to conflict prevention and other threats to human security.
Protection: The fundamental rights of women and girls throughout all phases of conflicts and in times of peace are respected, protected and promoted, and their human security is ensured.
Relief and Recovery: Women and girls are agents of change. Their specific needs and strategic interests are taken into account and their human security is ensured in crisis and reconstruction situations.
The NAP is aligned with national and international policy frameworks. On the national level, it is aligned with the Agreement for Peace and Reconciliation in Mali, as well as policies including those on combating SALW proliferation, gender, GBV, and sustainable development. Internationally and regionally, it aligns with AU, ECOWAS, and G5 Sahel commitments, and the SDGs.","Under the strategic framework, there are a number of results and associated indicators under each of the priority areas of the NAP. 
Under the priority of participation, result 1.2 of the NAP states that “Women are involved in mediation; negotiation; conflict management; forums for peace, security and social cohesion; in communities; and at the national, sub regional and international level.” Another result under prevention is 2.1 “All forms of conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence against women and girls are better prevented”. 
There are also sub-activities, labeled opportunities, associated with each activity. For example, under result 2.3, there are sub-activities 2.3.1 “The implementation of the National Policy for preventing and combating violent extremism and terrorism takes gender into account” and 2.3.2 “The social, cultural, political, religious and economic causes for violent extremism and terrorism are identified and analyzed through the lens of gender.”","There are a number of indicators associated with the results framework. For example: Under the result  2.1 “All forms of conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence against women and girls are better prevented”, indicators include “Changing the attitudes of girls, boys, women, and men in the face of SGBV” and sub-indicators under more specific results include “Number of men and boys engage in the fight to end all forms of conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence”.
NAP indicators are aligned with other global and national indicators, including those for the SDGs and for 1325 implementation.","There is a monitoring and evaluation framework detailed in the NAP (pg. 26) which includes details on the monitoring mechanism and knowledge management. The monitoring mechanism will meet quarterly, and there will be annual reporting on the NAP. Based on results and the context in Mali, there will be recommendations and changes made to the NAP.
The NAP provides detail on the progress made towards the previous NAPs, including the statistic that 50% of actions from the 2015-2017 NAP were successfully completed, as well as additional actions not included in the draft. It also provides good detail on the challenges faced in implementation, including ownership, emerging issues, and top-down decentralization of commitments.","Details about the NAP budget are provided (pg. 28); specifically, there is a dedicated budget for implementation and a mutual fund to finance other stakeholders’ implementation. This fund is co-managed by the MPLEL and UN Women. Some of the financing is provided by the government of Mali and other financing is from international donors. ","The NAP states that two of the frameworks that were taken into account in the development of the NAP were the National strategy for disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of ex-combatants (DDR) (2018) and the National Action Plan to Combat the Proliferation of Small Arms and Light Weapons in Mali (2014-2018). 
In addition to references to weapons in relation to DDR and in conflict prevention, including with regards to masculinity and gender roles, there are concrete actions on disarmament. Result 3.5 is “The safety of women and girls in the face of trafficking and small arms and light weapons circulation is improved”, with the indicator “Proportion of weapons seized, found or voluntarily returned, the illicit source or use of which has been traced or established by competent authorities, in accordance with international instruments”. Opportunity 3.5.1 is “Legislation related to small arms and light weapons is updated and aligned with international and regional instruments and takes gender into account”, with the indicator “How much the gender perspective is taken into account in legislation relating to small arms and light weapons."
Malta,"Malta adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2020 for the period 2020-2024. The NAP was developed by the Ministry for Foreign and European Affairs (MFEA). The NAP does not indicate civil society involvement in the NAP development process. Malta’s NAP builds on the country’s development and gender policies and is structured around four pillars, aligned with a modified version of the key pillars of UNSCR 1325: promotion, prevention, participation and partnership. Each of these pillars have various objectives, actions, indicators, along with implementation periods and responsible actors. The NAP also outlines a detailed monitoring and evaluation plan and states that the identified actions will be implemented in partnership with various government ministries and civil society. Malta does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but participates in Operation Atalanta , a European Union military operation to prevent piracy and armed robbery at sea off the Horn of Africa and in the Western Indian Ocean. Additionally, Malta joined NATO’s Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme in 1995, suspended participation in 1996, but reactivated its PfP membership in 2008. In March 2019, Malta signed the instrument of accession to the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (OP-CEDAW). In 2020, Malta appointed its first Ambassador for Women, Peace and Security, Cecilia Attard Pirotta, who will lead on all matters concerning Women, Peace and Security.",1991,90,2014,83.6M,"NAP Development
It is unclear whether civil society actors were involved in the development of Malta’s first NAP. 
The Ministry for Foreign and European Affairs (MFEA) was the lead agency involved in the NAP’s development process. 
NAP Implementation 
Although civil society actors are not the lead implementers of the NAP, they will be involved in its implementation. CSO actors will join the various government agencies to implement the actions listed in the NAP. 
While the Ministry for Foreign and European Affairs (MFEA) will be the NAP coordinator and oversee its implementation, the other government agencies involved in this process are: the Ministry for Justice, Equality and Governance (MJEG), the Ministry for Education and Employment (MEDE), the Ministry for Home Affairs, National Security and Law Enforcement (MHSE), the Ministry for the Family, Children’s Rights and Social Solidarity (MFCS), the Foundation for Social Welfare Services (FSWS) and the Ministry for Health. 
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
Civil society actors will be part of the Oversight Committee, which is responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of the NAP.
The Minister for Foreign and European Affairs will appoint an Oversight Committee, responsible for the NAP’s monitoring and evaluation. This committee will include representatives from government ministries, civil society, academia and independent individuals with relevant experience and expertise.","Malta released its first National Action Plan for the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 for the period 2020-2024. Moreover, under each pillar, there is an implementation timeframe for the actions. ","Malta’s NAP is designed and structured around four pillars, namely: Promotion, Prevention, Participation and Partnership. Each of these pillars have several objectives listed, for instance, Pillar 1:Promotion of the WPS Agenda Domestically and Internationally, has the following objectives: 
Raise awareness and sensitize local and foreign participants about the WPS agenda and Gender Equality
Promote and support knowledge sharing on WPS
Increase support for the WPS agenda internationally","Each of the four pillars of Malta’s NAP has various actions to be implemented. For instance, Pillar 2 Prevention of all Forms of Violence, including Gender-Based Violence (GBV) and Sexual Exploitation and Abuse (SEA) has the following actions: 
Organise events, campaigns and seminars on sexual and gender-based violence. 
Implementation of the Istanbul Convention.
Provide adequate support including treatment and counselling to victims of sexual violence.

Create awareness using the media.
Advocate for the elimination of female genital mutilation within international fora.
Continuous awareness-raising aimed at the general public.
Increase training programmes for Immigration Police and civilian immigration officers.","Under each pillar of the NAP, there are various indicators to measure the progress made on the respective actions. For instance, Pillar 3 Increased Participation and Representation of Women at all Decision-Making Levels, including Conflict Prevention and Peacebuilding has the following indicators: 
Percentage of women elected to leadership positions. 
Number of discussion forums organised and attended by women in MFEA. 
Number of female and male candidates received and sponsored. Increased funding. 
Number of women recruited annually. 
A number of sessions.
Annual monitoring.

Number of projects launched.","The Minister for Foreign and European Affairs (MFEA) will lead and chair the Oversight Committee which will include representatives from government ministries, civil society, academia and independent individuals with relevant experience and expertise. “The Committee will meet up to four times a year once the NAP is launched. These meetings will also include reporting on each of the four pillars by the different members of the Committee. An evaluation process of the first National Action Plan will commence at the end of 2023 and will end in June 2024, and preparations for the second National Action Plan, which will cover the period 2025-2029, will then start. The evaluation process will also include recommendations”.
The Committee’s responsibility includes: 
“supervising the regular and systematic evaluation of progress on achieving the outlined objectives and actions across all pillars in the NAP”;
“revising existing actions and targets in light of emerging issues and policy agendas on Women, Peace and Security, and in response to lessons learned coupled with challenges identified in the monitoring process”; 
“using outreach and communication mechanisms to ensure regular dissemination of updates to the stakeholders and, in particular, make sure that the perspectives of women affected by conflict are incorporated into the ongoing work of the Committee”.",The NAP does not mention any earmarked budget for the NAP’s implementation and it is unclear how the various actors will finance the implementation of actions.,"The Promotion and Participation pillars of the NAP include actions related to disarmament in particular DDR. 
Promotion Pillar: Advocate for the implementation of the WPS at the UN and the EU, especially in relation to DDR programmes, irregular migration, and trade in small arms. 
Participation Pillar: Provide a platform for women to engage in dialogues on peace and conflict-related issues such as DDR, migration, arms control, etc., which will, in turn, influence policies."

The plan was announced jointly by the The Ministry of Foreign Relations (SRE), the Ministry of National Defense (Sedena), the Ministry of the Navy (Semar), the Ministry of Security and Citizen Protection (SSPC) and the National Institute of Women (Inmujeres). The press release states that the NAP was prepared with the support of UN Women Mexico and results from the activities of the Working Group for Peace Operations (GT-OMP).
There is no mention of civil society in relation to the development of the NAP.
Implementation
The implementation of the NAP is the responsibility of an Inter-Agency Group (pg. 9). This group will rely on the Working Group of Peacekeeping Operations, and will contain representatives of the Secretariats of Foreign Affairs, National Defense, Navy, Security and Citizen Protection and by the National Institute of Women (INMUJERES), as well as other relevant agencies.
The NAP states that the “active participation of international organizations, academia, civil society, and other actors...will be promoted” in the NAP implementation (pg. 5). However, civil society are not participants in the working group identified in the document, and only one objective of the NAP references meetings with civil society.

WILPF Mexico was not listed as involved in the development of the NAP.","The structure and scope of the NAP will be reviewed after three years (pg. 5), although the NAP overall is not time-bound. However, some indicators detail activities that are meant to be completed on an annual basis or during a specific time period. ","The ten strategic objectives of the NAP outline key areas of activity for implementation of the WPS agenda in Mexico. These are listed below under each of the four pillars of the WPS agenda around which the NAP is structured: Prevention, Participation, Protection, and Relief and Recovery.
Prevention: 1) Disseminate and raise awareness among military and police personnel about the role of women in conflict prevention and peace processes. 2) Promote gender mainstreaming among the institutions responsible for peacekeeping and security in Mexico, particularly at the local level. 3) Mainstream gender into peacebuilding and security processes in the national territory.
Participation: 1) Enhance the substantive participation and pre-deployment training of women in uniform in United Nations Peace Operations. 2) Ensure the substantive participation of women in uniform in Peace Operations. 3) Promote the creation of networks of women peacemakers. 4) Promote the gender perspective and the empowerment of women in multilateral efforts for international peace and security, including peace processes and mediation efforts, the prevention and combating of violent extremism that can lead to terrorism, as well as in disarmament, non-proliferation, and arms control.
Protection: 1) Incorporate the protection of the human rights of women and girls and mainstream gender in the institutions that participate in Peace Operations. 2) Continue promoting the observance of the United Nations zero tolerance policy to prevent and respond to sexual exploitation and abuse.
Relief and Recovery: 1) Support gender mainstreaming in aid and humanitarian assistance efforts, as well as in post-conflict peacebuilding. ","Under each of the strategic objectives there are multiple actions, activities, and goals that are outlined in the plan (pgs. 17-25). 
For example:
Under the strategic objective #3 on prevention, which is to “Mainstream gender into peacebuilding and security processes in the national territory”, there are two actions: 
Promote the training of police institutions in the prevention of violence against women and girls, in particular sexual and gender-based violence, all from a gender and intercultural perspective and 
Create police forces specialized in the prevention, investigation, and prosecution of crimes of violence against women as part of the deployment of Gender Missions: “Women, Peace, and Security.
Under this same strategic objective, there are two activities:
Develop a program of gender-responsive and women rights-based training and/or workshops for police performance in peacebuilding and security processes. 
Train and integrate gender-responsive and intersectional police forces specialized in the prevention, investigation, and prosecution of crimes of violence against women in order to establish comprehensive actions aimed at guaranteeing the life, security, and human rights of women and girls.","The NAP contains a plan with specific activities and indicators (pgs.17-25). Under each of the strategic objectives, actions, and activities listed above, there are indicators and goals, which are linked to relevant agencies responsible for implementation.
Under the participation pillar strategic objective on promoting a gender perspective and the empowerment of women in multilateral efforts for peace and security, one indicator is: “Number of multilateral forums and meetings attended by women officials, experts or civil society representatives”. ","The monitoring and evaluation of the NAP will be carried out by an Inter-Secretariat Working Group. They will plan activities, acquire information for monitoring, prepare an annual report on the NAP, follow up on progress, and review and update the NAP and its indicators. This group is also responsible for engaging with other actors including civil society and academia.","The NAP does not provide a specific number for a budget, however, the section on financing (pg. 10) states: “Each coordinating institution must carry out the activities contemplated in the NAP-1325 with its own human and financial resources; therefore, in their annual budget, it will be required to program the necessary financial resources for the corresponding activities in accordance with the objectives of the Plan.” Additionally, this section highlights the potential role of international cooperation and exchange.","Disarmament and arms control are listed as areas of focus within the purpose and structure of the NAP (page 4-5). This is largely within the context of the participation pillar.
Under the participation pillar, strategic objective 4 specifically highlights disarmament and arms control. This objective states: “Promote the gender perspective and the empowerment of women in multilateral efforts for international peace and security, including peace processes and mediation efforts, the prevention and combating of violent extremism that can lead to terrorism, as well as in disarmament, non-proliferation, and arms control.” This objective is aligned with relevant indicators and activities.

Moldova,"Moldova adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2018 for the period 2018-2021 and its most recent for the period 2023-2027. The 2018 NAP was developed by a number of ministries, including the Ministries of Defense; Health, Labor and Social Protection; and Internal Affairs, through a participatory approach that included a series of dialogues, roundtables and meetings to increase the level of awareness of public authorities and civil society with the provisions of Resolution 1325. The NAP mentions civil society involvement in all stages of NAP development, implementation, and monitoring, with objective 6 specifically mentioning strengthening the involvement of civil society in the decisions taken by the security and defense systems. The NAP is primarily focused on women’s participation in the security and defense sectors and outlines eight key objectives, developed with the goal to increase women’s representation in the security and defense sectors. While identified objectives are tied to specific actions as well as a monitoring framework, the NAP does not have an allocated budget. Moldova reported on the implementation of its NAP in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country provided the following updates, among others (p. 5): The Republic of Moldova has improved the public policy framework on gender equality and in other related fields. Important strategic policy documents were adopted and their implementation commenced: 2017-2021 National Gender Equality Strategy, 2018-2023 National Strategy on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence, 2018-2023 National Strategy for Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Human Beings, National Action Plan on implementation of the provisions of the UNSCR 1325 Women in Peace and Security 2018-2022, as well as other sectorial strategies (health, employment, social protection, security, child protection, etc.). Currently, a structured institutional state mechanism in the area of gender equality is established, consisting of the Government Commission on Gender Equality, Division for Gender Equality Policies/MHLSP1, Gender Units/Gender Coordinating Groups within line ministries and other central public authorities, Gender Units within local public authorities. This denotes positive developments in achieving gender equality and promoting women. However, despite these achievements, the analysis of the situation in the Republic of Moldova on the issue of gender equality and promotion of women highlights that the biggest challenges during 2014-2019 were: empowering women in the political, economic, and social areas; work and family life reconciliation; domestic violence; and the specific situation of certain groups of disadvantaged women (Roma women, women from rural areas, women living with HIV, women in detention, migrant women, etc.). Moldova gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Since its independence, Moldova has experienced tensions with Ukraine over the Transnistrian territory and the Dniester river. Moldova is one of the primary source countries for women subjected to sex trafficking and forced labour throughout Europe.",1994,23,2015,44.5M,"The analysis in these tabs corresponds to the 2018 NAP.
NAP Development
Civil society formed part of the development of the NAP in partnership with government institutions.
WILPF does not have a country section in Moldova and therefore was not involved in the development process of Moldova’s NAP.
The NAP was developed with different ministries such as the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Health, Labor and Social Protection, Ministry of Internal Affairs.
NAP Implementation
In order to ensure an inclusive and transparent process of implementation of the National Program and Action Plan, the Reintegration Policy Bureau will create a group of implementing partners. Civil society organizations and development partners will be included by coordinating institutions to identify the most effective ways to coordinate efforts and programs aimed at promoting women and gender equality in the field of security and defense.
Along with the aforementioned ministries, central authorities will be responsible for accomplishing their objectives within the deadlines outlined in the NAP and submit necessary information to the responsible entities for creating reports on the implementation of each action, annually until January 5th. They are responsible for integrating the provisions from the NAP  into annual action plans, monitoring and reporting on progress and implementation difficulties on a regular basis, and designating a person responsible for coordinating this process.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
Civil society will  be involved in the implementation and monitoring stages.
The NAP will be undergo regular evaluations that will assess how delivery processes of the NAP’s strategic outcomes are led, how challenges are addressed and what best practices are to further build upon.  Based on the evaluations, if necessary, a set of amendments to further improve the NAP will be submitted to the Parliament of Georgia for approval.",The fourth NAP is to be implemented in a period of four years 2018-2021.,"The Moldovan NAP is outlined with eight key objectives. The objectives are the following:
Reducing the stereotypes about the role of women in the security and defense sector;
Improving the opportunities for women and men from the system to reconcile the professional and family life;
Preventing and responding to discrimination, harassment, and gender-based violence within the sector;
Developing an inclusive and pro-active human resources management system;
Implementing reasonable adjustment and special temporary measures in the security and defense system;
Strengthening the transparency and involvement of the civil society in the decisions taken by the security and defense system;
Developing the institutional capacity for mainstreaming gender in security and defense policies;
Supporting the participation of women in peacebuilding and peacekeeping missions.",,"Each activity has a set of indicators attached. For example, for Objective 6 - ""Strengthening the transparency and involvement of the civil society in the decisions taken by the security and defense system"", lists the following indicator:
Growth % of recommendations received from citizens and NGOs.","The NAP will be undergo regular evaluations that will assess how delivery processes of the NAP’s strategic outcomes are led, how challenges are addressed and what best practices are to further build upon.  Based on the evaluations, if necessary, a set of amendments to further improve the NAP will be submitted to the Parliament of Georgia for approval.","Throughout the implementation stages, the funding for the NAP will come from the annually approved allocations of the responsibly authority or institution’s budget.  However, no specific budget is included.",The NAP fails to include any references to disarmament.
Montenegro,"Montenegro adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2017 for the period 2017-2018.

The NAP does not mention civil society involvement in the NAP development process. The NAP is mostly oriented towards ensuring women’s participation in the security sector at the local (police force), national (armed forces) and international (peacekeeping) levels. It also addresses the issue of human trafficking in Montenegro and provides mechanisms to address it regionally and internationally as well as protecting women and girls from discrimination and gender-based violence. The NAP specifies, under each objective and activity, a responsible entity for achieving the tasks identified and provides indicators to measure their implementation. While relevant ministries and donors are responsible for funding the NAP, there is no specific budget attached to the NAP. Montenegro reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country provided the following updates, among others (pp. 50-51): Reporting on the implementation of the Action Plan is regular and is carried out on an annual basis. The Ministry of Defence and the Army of Montenegro are the bearers of responsibility for 20 activities, out of which 17 activities are already implemented, one activity is on-going and two activities have not been implemented. In February 2019, the draft of the new Action Plan with the Implementation Program 2019- 2020 has been made and it is in the process of adoption. The Committee for Gender Equality of the Montenegrin Parliament, at the joint sessions with the Committee for Security and Defence, examines reports on the implementation of the Action Plan for the Implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution on Women, Peace and Security in Montenegro, defining measures and activities to integrate gender equality issues in the processes of defence system reform and at all levels in which decisions are made and policies are created and implemented. The Committee has, in the previous period, organized an International Conference “Cetinje Parliamentary Forum: Women, Peace and Security” with the aim of implementing and understanding Resolution 1325 and its accompanying resolutions (R1820, R1888 and R1889) as well as exchanging regional and international experiences when it comes to women’s participation in the security system and the definition of future activities in this field and the continuation of good regional cooperation between parliaments and governments, as well as with the non-governmental sector. Montenegro became an independent state in 2006, after a referendum that resulted in the country’s peaceful separation from Serbia, both of whom were previously part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Montenegro does not have a recent history of armed conflict; however, it was involved in military aggression during the war in Bosnia (1991-1995).

Mozambique,"Mozambique adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2018 for the period 2018-2022. The NAP was developed by the Gender, Children and Social Welfare Ministry in partnership with UN Women and the governments of Iceland and Norway. The NAP includes priority actions to be implemented by state institutions, civil society and cooperation partners in the context of women’s participation in conflict management and resolution; assistance for displaced and refugee women; the prevention of violence and sexual abuse; and post-conflict reconstruction. The NAP keeps women’s and girls’ human rights in conflict and post-conflict at the forefront of its focus, with the goal to integrate a gender perspective in all actions and strategies on conflict prevention and management; expand efforts for the security, physical and mental health dignity of women and girls; and secure the rights of women and girls in conflict and post-conflict situations. Furthermore, the NAP includes an allocated budget, broken down by priority sections. Mozambique reported on the implementation of its NAP in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Mozambique gained independence from Portugal in 1975, after ten years of liberation efforts, and experienced a civil war that ended in 1992 with the signing of the Rome General Peace Accords. Mozambique continues to experience the negative social, political, and economic impacts of the war, which had a distinct gendered impact of women, specifically through the usage of sexual violence as a weapon of war. Furthermore, women survivors of the civil war continue to suffer from the traumatic effects of their experiences, silenced and given no right to reparations. Despite the negative impacts of the war, women also played a role as peacebuilders and activists, in particular through assisting victims of armed conflict.",1991,56,2018,137M,"NAP Development

Integrating a gender perspective in all actions and strategies on conflict prevention and management;
Guaranteeing the participation of women in decision making structures in peace and security processes;
Promoting mechanisms to secure increased recruitment, retention and promotion of women in defence and security, and justice bodies;
Reinforcing the fight against all forms of violence against women and girls in armed and non-armed conflict contexts.",,"Each strategic objective has a number of listed indicators. For example, the first objective  on policy and legal framework on women, peace and security include several indicators of which different entities are responsible for such as. For instance, for the following objectives, the Ministry of Gender, Child, and Social Action, Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, as well as all key sectors are responsible:
Greater representation and participation of involved sectors in group meetings;
Number of staff in key sectors trained on women, peace and security issues;
Number of UNSC resolutions and other legislation on women, peace and security ratified and implemented in the country.","The monitoring and evaluation framework incorporates an annual report  based on the indicators outlined. This was was developed after careful consultations with civil society, non-governmental and governmental actors. Monitoring will be done from the perspectives of civil society and government bodies, through a Monitoring and Evaluation Committee. The committee should present two annual reports, one from civil society and one from governmental bodies, and hold two alignment and extraordinary semi-annual meetings. The final report will include both perspectives.","The NAP has an allocated budget with a total of 116, 835, 00 MZM. Each priority section of the NAP has an allocated budget as well as the entities responsible for the action.",Mozambique’s NAP does not discuss disarmament issues.
Namibia,"Namibia adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2019 for the period 2019-2024. The NAP was developed by a National Task Team, which consisted of several ministries and UN technical advisors. Civil society organizations were included in the development process of the NAP through consultative meetings. Namibia’s NAP builds on the country’s National Gender Policy, developed for the 2010-2020 period. The NAP is also seen as complementary to the other mechanisms and frameworks developed to advance women’s rights in Namibia. The overarching goal of the NAP is to create “a safe and peaceful Namibia where all women, men, girls and boys have equal rights and live without fear or want and in dignity” (p. 16). The NAP includes a detailed implementation matrix, which includes an allocated budget. Namibia reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country provided the following updates, among others (pp. 62-63): Namibia has aligned its outcome indicators to the AU Continental Results framework where relevant. Progress on the implementation of the Action Plan will be monitored annually to look at the challenges faced by stakeholders in the implementation of the Action Plan; proposals of possible solutions to these challenges; and documenting successes and planning for possible replication. Gender equality is an important tenet of Namibia’s Foreign Policy, and as a result, in 2016, Namibia, together with Spain, Canada, Chile, Japan, and the United Arab Emirates launched the Global Focal Points Network, in recognition that national and regional efforts are vital for the full and effective implementation of the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) Agenda. In 2018, Namibia successfully inscribed Women, Peace and Security as a standalone agenda item at the last meeting of the Ministerial Committee of the Organ of the Southern African Development Community (SADC). The result of this is that SADC member states are now required to report to SADC about their national activities and policies as they relate to the effective implementation of the WPS Agenda. The National Development Plan (NDP5), the Harambee Prosperity Plan, (2015), The National Gender Policy (2010-2020) and National Plan of Action on Gender- Based Violence (2012-2016) are all frameworks that address gender equality, gender mainstreaming and the protection of women. Namibia gained independence from South Africa in 1990. The most recent armed conflict in the country’s history is the Caprivi Conflict , which lasted from 1994 until 1999 and took place between the Namibian government and the secessionist Caprivi Liberation Army. The conflict displaced thousands of people, who took refuge in the neighboring Botswana. At the multilateral level, Namibia most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 1999-2000. The Council adopted Resolution 1325, the landmark resolution of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) Agenda, under the Presidency of Namibia on 31 October 2000.",1992,12,2014,410M,"NAP Development
The NAP indicates that civil society organizations were included in the development process of the NAP through consultative meetings. 
WILPF does not have a country section in Namibia and therefore was not involved in the development process of Namibia’s NAP.
The NAP was developed by a National Task Team, which consisted of the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Gender Equality and Child Welfare, Ministry of International Relations and Cooperation, and UN technical advisors. The Ministry of Defense chaired the team while the Ministry of Gender Equality and Child Welfare, Ministry of International Relations and Cooperation acted as co-chairs. Additionally, the NAP development process also entailed consultative meetings with multiple stakeholders, including government ministries, security sector institutions, traditional authorities, the military, women’s organisations, faith-based organisations, civil society, and youth organisations. 
NAP Implementation
The NAP identifies civil society organizations as among the key actors of several strategic objectives. For example, strategic objective #1 (To mainstream a gender perspective in security sector legislation) lists “relevant civil society institutions” as among the key actors. However, the NAP does not further specify which organizations will be a part of the implementation. 
Multiple ministries are tasked with implementing the NAP on the implementation matrix alongside other actors, such as civil society organizations and regional councils. 
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
The NAP does not indicate civil society inclusion in the monitoring and evaluation of the NAP.
The NAP indicates that the Ministry of Gender Equality and Child Welfare will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the NAP. ",The implementation period of the NAP is five years (2019-2024).,"The NAP identifies 10 objectives (referred to as “priority areas”), compiled under the four pillars of UNSCR 1325: participation, prevention, protection, and relief and recovery. On Namibia’s NAP, participation has three objectives, prevention has three objectives, protection has two objectives, and relief and recovery has two objectives listed. Each priority area has its own strategic objectives. For example, priority area #2 listed under participation is: “Participation of women in peace and security structures” (p. 19). Strategic objective #1 for this priority area is: “To mainstream a gender perspective in security sector legislation” (p.19, implementation matrix).",,"The NAP identifies several indicators, both qualitative and quantitative, for each objective, outlined in the implementation matrix. For example, strategic objective #1 listed under participation identifies, “Number of legislation reviewed and updated” and “Existence of gender inclusive reviews and directives” as indicators and means of verification (p. 19, implementation matrix). ","The NAP indicates that the Ministry of Gender Equality and Child Welfare will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the NAP and that implementation will be monitored annually. Additionally, the document states that the NAP “will be accompanied by a monitoring and evaluation plan, to be used by different stakeholders” and that all actors responsible for implementing the NAP will need to report on their activities (p. 32). However, the NAP does not specify when or how the plan will be developed or made available. ","The NAP includes an estimated budget of $3 million, broken down with separate estimates for five fiscal years, for the implementation of the action plan. ",The NAP does not address disarmament in its objectives or scope of implementation.
Nepal,"Nepal adopted its second and most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2022 for the period 2022-2025. The initial draft of the NAP was prepared by the former Ministry of Peace and Reconstruction and after the department dissolution, the work continued under the Ministry of Home Affairs (p.6). Various governmental departments, province and local level government organizations, international development partners, civil society, “affected groups”, as well as women’s networks and organizations also contributed to the NAPs production (p.1). The NAP identifies four priority areas, aligned with the primary pillars of UNSCR 1325: participation; protection and prevention; relief and recovery; and capacity development, resource management and monitoring and evaluation. Each priority area has various associated activities, the expected result/output of that activity, a performance indicator, the agency responsible for achieving it, a time period, and a supporting partner agency is necessary (p.13). There is no explicit budget for the NAP, however it does state that relevant ministries and agencies will prepare annual budget reports and a three-year expenditure projection in order to implement the second NAP’s activities (p.48). Overall, the NAP is extremely similar in structure, style and content to Nepal’s previous NAP, published in 2011 for the period 2011-2016. Between 2016 and the publication of the second NAP in 2022, there was no active NAP on WPS for Nepal. Nepal reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country reported on progress areas and gaps (pp. 44-49). The most recent armed conflict in Nepal’s history is the civil war, which took place from 1996 until 2006. The conflict resulted in thousands of casualties and enforced disappearances. Even though the conflict had distinct gendered impacts , including the systematic use of sexual violence as a weapon of war as well as the inclusion of women combatants, women were excluded from the peace process and were not among the negotiators or signatories of the peace agreement. In 2015, the country established a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) and a Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons (CIEDP), with the goal to expedite legal action against perpetrators. Nevertheless, there has been a persistent lack of accountability, with ongoing impunity for perpetrators of human rights violations.",1991,116,,428M,,"The NAP covers the period 2011-2016, and also provides specific timeframes for the actions presented. The timeframes given described as ""five years from the first year"" or ""three years for the first year"", for example.",,,,,,
Netherlands,"The Netherlands adopted its fourth National Action Plan (NAP) for the period 2021-2025. The fourth NAP states that its main vision is “a world of sustainable peace, security and development for all, where equal participation of women and girls is self-evident.” It has five strategic outcomes, which correlate to the four main pillars of the WPS agenda and also prioritize gender mainstreaming. The fourth Dutch National Action Plan was developed through a consultative process with a range of actors, including ministries such as the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Defence, Justice and Security, and Education, Science, and Culture, and the police service. Additionally, over 60 civil society organisations participated. All of these actors together are part of the Dutch NAP partnership. The fourth NAP is preceded by three others, for the periods 2016-2019, 2012-2015, and 2008-2011. The second, third, and fourth NAPs both have standalone sections that provide an overview of the implementation of the previous action plans as well as “lessons learned” for the revised NAP. The third NAP, for instance, states that the Policy and Operations Evaluation Department (IOB) of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the body responsible body for evaluating the implementation of the NAP, found out that “the NAPs have not provided guidance … on how to translate the resolution’s objectives into actions that are responsive to contextual gender realities” (p. 21). As such, the third NAP aims to strengthen its gender-specific analysis as well as monitoring and evaluation mechanism. All four NAPs approach the implementation of the WPS agenda mostly internationally. The first three NAPs approach disarmament through the narrow framework of disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) efforts, and the fourth NAP has an objective of implementing Article 7.4 of the Arms Trade Treaty. The Netherlands does not have a recent history of conflict, but plays a large role in international peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts. The Netherlands is a contributing donor to the Women’s Peace and Humanitarian Fund , a global partnership that works to empower women in conflict zones and humanitarian crises. The Netherlands is also a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies , a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. In 2016, the Dutch parliament passed a bill to halt arms exports to Saudi Arabia, over concerns about violations of humanitarian law in Yemen. In 2019, the Netherlands was among the top 15 arms exporters in the world. At the multilateral level, the Netherlands most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for a one-year term in 2017, splitting the ordinarily two-year term with Italy due to a deadlocked election result.",1991,38,2014,12B,"The fourth Dutch National Action Plan was developed through a consultative process with a range of actors, including ministries such as the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Defence, Justice and Security, and Education, Science, and Culture, and the police service. Additionally, over 60 civil society organisations participated. All of these actors together are part of the Dutch NAP partnership. The full list of NAP partners is available here.
All partners involved in the NAP have a responsibility to report on its implementation. Government bodies “have an institutional obligation to report to the UN on their contribution to implementing Resolution 1325, the 10 successive WPS resolutions and CEDAW, as well as to the EU on the EU Action Plan on WPS. They are also responsible for annual reports to the House of Representatives.” Civil society organizations also have an M&E obligation to provide insight into their implementation efforts.
WILPF Netherlands is one of the partners of the National Action Plan, and is listed as such on the partner website. ",The NAP will be implemented from 2021 to 2025.,"The NAP states that its main vision is “a world of sustainable peace, security and development for all, where equal participation of women and girls is self-evident.”
It has five strategic outcomes, which correlate to the four main pillars of the WPS agenda and also prioritize gender mainstreaming. These are:
(1) Participation: more women hold leadership positions, and women participate equally and meaningfully in decision-making processes at every level in the interests of peace and security, including conflict prevention and resolution, peacebuilding, protection, relief, reconstruction and recovery.
(2) Prevention: conflict prevention and the prevention of violent extremism, including of related violence against women and girls, is based on the human rights approach and starts from the principle of human security. Prevention policy and its implementation are conflict-sensitive, gender-sensitive, gender-responsive and gender-transformative.
(3) Protection: women and girls, as well as men and boys, in and from conflict situations, are protected against all forms of conflict-related violence, including sexual and gender-based violence. Their rights are safeguarded and enforceable.
(4) Relief, reconstruction and recovery: relief, reconstruction and recovery meet the needs and contribute to the empowerment and human security of women and girls.
(5) WPS mainstreaming: a gender lens is applied to every reorganisation, improvement, development and evaluation of analysis, policy and policy implementation with regard to peace and security.",,"There are numerous indicators in the NAP which correlate to the strategic outcomes. These are both qualitative and quantitative, incorporating various methods to assess progress towards the NAP. They are correlated with responsible actors and modes of implementation.
Under Strategic outcome 1 on participation, examples of indicators are:
Examples of women reporting improved meaningful participation in decisionmaking (through self-assessments and storytelling)
# of times that civil society organisations (CSOs) or community leaders have succeeded in creating space for CSO demands and positions on women’s meaningful and equal participation and leadership in conflict prevention, peacebuilding and state-building, and protecting women’s and girls’ rights in crisis, conflict and post-conflict situations, through agenda setting, influence on debates and/or movement-building
# of Dutch government initiatives to engage, support and protect women’s rights organisations (WROs), women human rights defenders (WHRDs) and peace builders in country analysis and peace processes","The fourth Dutch NAP has a monitoring, evaluation, accountability, and learning framework (pg 40). Within the NAP it states that this framework will be improved and refined (if necessary) over the course of implementation from 2021-2025.
The framework states that all partners are jointly responsible for implementation, and have made commitments to one or more outcomes/sub-outcomes. There will be annual reporting, for which there is joint responsibility. This annual reporting will help strengthen learning for better results. The NAP states that there will be bi-annual events, learning events, country and thematic groups, webinars, newsletters, a website, and a Twitter account.
To help facilitate M&E, there are baseline 2020 figures for many of the indicators of the NAP; where these do not exist there will be reporting in 2021. The NAP will attempt to disaggregate data.
There will be an independent evaluation of the NAP in 2025.","Although a specific figure for a budget is not indicated in the NAP, a standalone WPS budget does exist and is referenced in the NAP, as well as prior impacts of earmarked financing. There are several indicators that are specifically related to financing in terms of evaluating the NAP. These include:
Total Dutch expenditure on the WPS agenda, including both the stand-alone WPS
budget and WPS mainstreaming
Proportion of funding allocated to CSOs that has been spent on WPS in conflict affected
Countries","The international context of the NAP links weapons to women’s insecurity, stating that “Increased militarisation, the steady spread of small arms and light weapons, the development of new weapons and the lack of a gender lens in the security and justice sector have for decades now been exacerbating conflicts, gender inequality and conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence” (pg. 60). The Arms Trade Treaty is listed (pg. 9) one of the international obligations that have strengthened commitment to the WPS agenda. 
One area of action for the NAP will be the implementation of article 7.4 of the Arms Trade Treaty, with regards to the potential impacts of the Dutch arms trade on GBV (pg. 27). The NAP states that the Netherlands will “monitor where Dutch arms export or transit leads to an increased risk of sexual and gender-based violence. We also work to gather and publish sex and age disaggregated data (SADD) as part of national crime and health statistics, including data on victims of armed violence and conflicts. Moreover, in line with the outcomes of the fifth Conference of State Parties to the Arms Trade Treaty (2019), we support research that improves our understanding of the gendered impact of armed violence in the context of the ATT.” (pg. 28)"
New Zealand,"New Zealand adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2015 for the period 2015-2019. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade in coordination with the New Zealand Defence Force, New Zealand Police, and the Ministry for Women. The NAP does not indicate civil society involvement in the NAP development process. The NAP identifies four overarching objectives that align with the primary pillars of UNSCR 1325: prevention, participation, protection, and peace, relief, and recovery. The NAP approaches the implementation of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda mostly internationally, identifying WPS actions in a number of conflict-affected countries, including Afghanistan, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Timor-Leste. Additionally, the NAP has the goal to improve international deployment rates of senior staff within the New Zealand Defense Force and New Zealand Police as well as to increase the numbers of women at decision-making levels in peacekeeping and assistance missions. While the NAP’s objectives have corresponding actions and indicators, the NAP does not have an allocated budget. New Zealand reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). New Zealand does not have a recent history of conflict, but it was involved in overseas military operations, including in Iraq and Afghanistan. The New Zealand Special Air Service (SAS) faced allegations of war crimes, including torture, committed during Operation Burnham , a joint operation undertaken in 2010 in Afghanistan. The New Zealand government initiated an official inquiry to address the allegations in 2018, which resulted in the delivery of four overarching recommendations , including establishing an office of the Independent Inspector-General of Defence “to facilitate oversight over the New Zealand Defense Force and enhance its democratic accountability” (p. 33). In 2019, New Zealand was among the top 15 countries in the world with the biggest increase in their military expenditure, with a 19% increase in its military spending. Additionally, New Zealand is a major contributor to humanitarian aid and operations. At the multilateral level, New Zealand most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2015-2016.",1985,6,2014,2.9B,,"The implementation period for this National Action Plan is five years, from 2015 to 2019.","New Zealand’s National Action Plan addresses the role of women within New Zealand, including those working in government agencies directly associated with peacemaking and conflict prevention, those in civil society organisations and society more broadly, as well as women outside New Zealand in our immediate Pacific region, and globally.
The New Zealand National Action Plan for implementation of Security Council Resolutions on Women, Peace and Security has been developed in line with the four fundamental objectives identified by the United Nations Secretary General of:
Prevention (of conflict and of violations of rights of women and girls)
Participation
Protection
Peacebuilding, relief and recovery","Each one of the four fundamental objectives, include a list of various actions, as well as indicators and the responsible government actors that will take the lead and will be responsible for. In the first fundamental goal, “Prevention (of conflict and of violations of rights of women and girls)”, there are six actions assigned:
New Zealand will advocate at international fora for women, peace and security issues to be included in political and security discussions, in particular for peacekeeping operations and conflict prevention responses, including up to the level of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC).
New Zealand Defence Fporces (NZDF) and New Zealand (NZ) Police will review their doctrine, policy, directives and deployment planning frameworks relevant to UNSC-mandated missions, international assistance missions and other peacekeeping operations, to ensure effective adoption of women, peace and security commitments.
New Zealand government agencies engaged in the prevention of conflict will formalise the inclusion of women, peace and security into NZDF and NZ Police pre deployment and other training.
NZDF and NZ Police will include information on violations of women’s and girls’ human rights that occur during participation in UNSC-mandated peacekeeping missions, international assistance missions and other peacekeeping operations in their periodic reporting, according to mandate.
NZDF and NZ Police will be responsive to and investigate any violations of the rights of women and girls that occur during participation in UNSC mandated peacekeeping missions, international assistance missions and other peacekeeping operations, in line with relevant international standards.
Where a credible allegation of the commission of a crime during a peacekeeping operation is raised by the United Nations against a New Zealander, New Zealand will inform the United Nations of the progress of the investigation and prosecution process.","Each of the actions that are set for each of the fundamental objectives, include indicators. For instance, the first action of the second fundamental objective, “Participation”, sets that: “New Zealand will advocate at international fora to increase the quantity and seniority of women’s representation in national and United Nations-led peace processes.” The indicator established for this action is the following: “number and type of statements made and recorded”.","New Zealand agencies will establish a gender-balanced inter-agency Women, Peace and Security Advisory Group, to professionalise New Zealand’s responses to women, peace and security issues and to guide and monitor implementation and reporting under this National Action Plan. Annual reports will be submitted to responsible Ministers (Foreign Affairs, Police, Defence, Women), led by the United Nations, Human Rights and Commonwealth Division (UNHC) of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT).","New Zealand’s National Action Plan does not include an allocated or estimated budget. No indicators or actions are included that formulate fundraising strategies, detail what level of funding is required for which specific activities, or what accountability mechanisms will ensure funding is raised and used in implementing the NAP.",New Zealand's NAP refers to discussing the arms trade but does not state any direct actions to be taken.
Niger,"Niger adopted its second National Action Plan (NAP) for the period 2020-2024. This NAP follows a previous one, adopted in 2016 for the period 2016-2018. Analysis of the 2020-2024 NAP is forthcoming. The 2016-2018 NAP was developed by the Ministry of Population, Women’s Empowerment and Child Protection, through a participatory approach that included consultations with civil society organisations, NGOs, and technical and financial partners. The NAP focuses on four priority axes, including: prevention of conflict and gender-based violence; protection, assistance and rehabilitation of victims; participation and representation; coordination, monitoring and evaluation of activities. However, the NAP, while referencing the impact of armed conflict on women, does not offer any specific actions for disarmament and arms control, including monitoring mechanisms for assessing the impact of arms proliferation on sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). While the NAP offers financing specifics as well as a detailed monitoring and evaluation framework, it does not have a timeline. Niger reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the report indicates that Niger supported the establishment of the G5 Sahel Women’s Platform and the development of a three-year action plan for 2019-2021 (p. 37). Niger gained independence from France in 1960, after decades of colonial rule. The country experienced military rule and rebellions, including a military coup in 2010, leading to widespread social and political instability, including lack of access to natural resources; lack of access to public resources, including the redistribution of income from extractive industries; a demographic dividend and marginalisation of women and youth; weak governance, social tensions and the recurrence of political and institutional instability; armed conflicts, including armed rebellions in the northern part of the country. Additionally, socio-political turmoil in Libya, armed conflict in Mali, the presence of Boko Haram and the presence of terrorist groups in the north-west have all led to displacement throughout Niger and an influx of migrants. Most recently, in 2020, Niger received thousands of migrants and asylum seekers, who were expelled by Algeria.",1999,,2015,172M,,,,,,,,
Nigeria,"Nigeria adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2017 for the period 2017-2020. The NAP was developed by the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development with the support of the Nigerian Stability Reconciliation Programme (NSRP), the European Union, and UN Women. The NAP’s objectives are compiled under five overarching thematic pillars: prevention and disaster preparedness; participation and representation; protection and prosecution; crisis management, early recovery, and post-conflict reconstruction; and partnerships, coordination, and management. The strategic objectives have corresponding actions, outcomes, indicators, target completion timeframes, and lead actors. Nevertheless, the NAP does not include an allocated budget. Nigeria’s most recent NAP is preceded by one other NAP, adopted in 2013 and implemented for the period 2013-2017. In the course of implementing the first NAP, several gaps were observed and formed the basis, among other reasons, to review the plan in order to incorporate emerging issues in Nigeria (i.e., non-inclusion of violent extremism and limited consideration of post-conflict and reintegration issues), as well as address the gaps identified (i.e., absence of crisis management and recovery strategies, ambiguous language and inadequate monitoring and evaluation architecture). Nigeria reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country indicated that there has been inclusion of women in councils of traditional rulers and periodic gender training for security sector agencies; the social investment budget has been formally introduced into the government budget; and there has been a marginal upsurge in women’s political participation (p. 14). Nigeria gained independence in 1960 from the United Kingdom, after decades of colonial rule by the British empire. Between 1967 and 1970, Nigeria experienced a civil war, which was preceded by a history of military coups. Most recently, since 2009, the conflict in the country’s northeast caused by Boko Haram has resulted in an upsurge in violence against women and girls, manifesting itself in the form of systematic abductions. Specifically, following the abductions in 2014, international security meetings on countering Boko Haram were held in London and Paris but failed to include Nigerian women’s civil society organisations. At the multilateral level, Nigeria most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2014-2015.",1985,128,2013,1.860B,"NAP Development
The review process of Nigeria's NAP was inclusive, participatory and included input from civil society organisations and faith-based organisations. A Steering Committee on UNSCR1325 provided guidance for the overall preparation process. The Steering Committee consisted of various government ministries, UN entities and civil society organizations.    
The Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development was the lead agency in the development process of Nigeria's NAP. The NAP Steering Committee, which consisted of government ministries, departments, agencies and civil society organisations, provided guidance for the overall NAP development process.                         
NAP Implementation
Civil society organisations will be present in the process of NAP implementation along with federal ministries, Nigerian Emergency Management Agency (NEMA), National Refugee Commission and development partners, such as UN Women, UNHCR, UNFPA and others.
The Federal Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development is in charge of providing strategic leadership, overall guidance and supervision for the NAP implementation.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
The monitoring and evaluation framework which also incorporates a reporting template was developed after careful consultations at zonal and national levels, including with leaders of civil society.
The monitoring and evaluation framework, which also incorporates a reporting template, was developed after careful consultations at zonal and national levels, including with leaders of civil society. This framework is to be used at all levels such as federal, state and community levels. The National Technical Working Group (NTWG) has a critical role in the monitoring and evaluation of the plan. Reports from the local and state levels can be sent to the NAP Secretariat housed in the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs.
WILPF's Contributions to Nigeria's NAP
WILPF Nigeria actively participated in the development process of the second Nigerian NAP. Joy Onyesoh, WILPF Nigeria’s President, has served as a zonal consultant for the South West of Nigeria providing technical insights and guidance to the process. WILPF Nigeria participated in the validation process of the reviewed NAP.
WILPF Nigeria aims to provide a platform to address conflicts through peaceful and nonviolent means, and to build women’s capacity as leaders both at the grassroots and national levels. To fulfil its mission, WILPF Nigeria uses the CEDAW and the UNSCR 1325 as a powerful tool to advocate for women’s rights and for a better representation of women within security issues. The Section organises seminars for women’s capacity building and for increasing the overall understanding of human rights, while promoting women as agents of change and peace.
WILPF Nigeria is also leading the implementation of the Women’s Situation Room Nigeria (WSRN) which makes the connection between women’s essential role in conflict prevention and women’s active participation in the electoral process, specifically related to observing, monitoring, and reporting on electoral and gender-based violence during the elections.",The implementation period for the Nigerian National Plan of Action is three years (2017-2020).,"The primary objectives of Nigeria's NAP are focused on what Nigeria's NAP refers to as the Five Pillars: Prevention, Participation, Protection, Crisis Management, Partnerships.
Prevention and Disaster Preparedness: To  ensure prevention of conflict and all forms of violence against women and girls, institute coping mechanisms and systems for averting and mitigating disasters;
 Protection and Prosecution: To ensure the rights of women and girls are protected and promoted in conflict and peace and also to prosecute such rights violations;
 Participation and Representation: To increase participation and engagement of women and inclusion of women’s interests in decision-making processes related to conflict prevention and peacebuilding;
 Crisis Management, Early Recovery and Post-Conflict Reconstruction: To ensure specific relief and recovery needs of women and girls are met and women’s capacities to act as agents in crisis, recovery and post-conflict situations are reinforced;
 Partnerships, Coordination and Management: To ensure increase in the capacity and resources to coordinate, implement, monitor and report on women, peace and security plans and programmes.","Each area of work has different actions assigned. For example, Pillar 1 (Prevention and Disaster Preparedness) includes the following actions:
Establishment of new laws aimed at protecting women and girls in conflict and disaster;
Implementation of existing and new laws and policies that enhance conflict prevention systems for women;
Training of MDAs (Ministries, Departments and Agencies) and stakeholders on inclusive and gender-responsive approaches to services for conflict and disaster prevention.","Each strategic objective has a number of listed indicators. For example, the first objective of Pillar 1, “Establishment of new laws aimed at protecting women and girls in conflict and disaster”, includes several indicators:
Number and types of laws and policies enacted;
Level of compliance to laws and policies safeguarding women from conflict;
Extent to which preventable disasters and violations of human rights of women and girls are reported, referred and investigated;
Number and any types of cases/actions taken/recommendations made to address preventable disasters and violations affecting women and girls.","The monitoring and evaluation framework which also incorporates a reporting template was developed after careful consultations at zonal and national levels, including with leaders of civil society. This framework is to be used at all levels such as federal, state, zonal and community levels.","Pillar 5 of the NAP aims at ensuring increase in resources available to to coordinate, implement, monitor and report on women, peace and security plans and programmes. The NAP will be financed through domestic and external support through a multi-stakeholder approach. Domestic sources include state and non-state actors operating within Nigeria such as the Organized Private Sector, revenue generating state agencies, state governments, and financial Financial Institutions. External sources include UN entities, Regional Economic Community and multi/bi-lateral relations.","Nigeria's NAP does not discuss disarmament issues despite the recent conflicts and use of small arms that have affected women, children, and the civilian population in general."
North Macedonia,"North Macedonia adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2013 for the period 2013-2015. The NAP does not specify the responsible actor for NAP development, but the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy appears to be an important actor in the NAP’s development. The NAP identifies three overarching objectives: strengthen the gender perspective in the formulation and implementation of the peace, security and defense policy of the Republic of Macedonia; strengthen the participation and contribution of women to international, civilian and military missions in which the Republic of Macedonia takes part; and prevent violence and protect women’s rights in the time of peace and humanitarian disasters. The NAP does not identify specific actions, indicators, or a monitoring and evaluation framework and does not have an allocated budget. North Macedonia reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country indicated the preparation of a revised NAP. Additionally, since 2018, the Ministry of Defense has been implementing the Methodology for Gender Responsive Budgeting and a Gender Budget Statement. North Macedonia (formerly Macedonia) gained independence from former Yugoslavia in 1991. During 1998-1999, the country became a host to more than 250,000 refugees fleeing the war in Kosovo. In 2001, Macedonia experienced conflict between state security forces and Albanian insurgents, which ended with the signing of the Ohrid Agreement . In 2012, the country experienced resurging tension between etnic Albanians and ethic Macedonians, resulting in civil unrest and casualties. In 2019, North Macedonia was among the top 10 countries in the world with the biggest increase in their military expenditure, with a 30% increase in its military spending.",1994,70,2014,151M,"NAP Development

Norway,"Norway adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2023 for the period 2023-2030. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Justice and Public Security, the Ministry of Culture and Equality, the Ministry of Labour and Social Inclusion, and the Ministry of Climate and Environment (p.6).  The NAP also indicates that Norwegian and international civil society organizations, as well as Norwegian research institutes and other relevant experts, provided input and advice throughout the NAP’s development (p.6). Norway’s NAP approaches the implementation of the WPS Agenda both domestically and internationally, and identifies three thematic priorities: peace process and implementation of peace agreements; security policy and operations; and humanitarian efforts, protection of civilians and protection of human rights (p.6). The NAP addresses conflict prevention by committing itself to an intersectional analysis of peace and security (p.6), as well as supporting civil society, women’s organizations and human rights defenders in conflict prevention and peacebuilding efforts (p.13). Notably, under issues relating to the thematic area ‘security policy and operations’, the NAP includes a section on ‘women and climate, peace and security’, where it commits to linking the women, peace and security and climate, peace and security agendas, and dealing with these as interconnected and cross-cutting issues (p.25). Unlike the previous NAP, this one does not include monitoring and evaluation outcomes and indicators. Rather, it outlines different levels of implementation, ministries and actors that are responsible for implementation, and a timeline for reviews (p.36). This includes annual reports on efforts, results and problems related to implementation of the NAP, as well as an interministerial review in 2027 (p.37). The NAP does not include an allocated budget, though indicates that the NAP “retains the approach of integrating the women, peace and security agenda into the whole breadth of peace and security work rather than creating budget items specifically for this area” (p.36). Norway’s fifth NAP is preceded by four other NAPS, adopted in 2006, 2011, 2015 and 2019, implemented for the periods 2006-2011; 2011-2015; 2015-2018 and 2019-2022, respectively. In Norway’s third NAP, priority countries were introduced and then expanded on in the fourth NAP to include Afghanistan, Colombia, Myanmar, Palestine, South Sudan and Nigeria. In the fifth NAP, this list has grown substantially, and Iraq, Jordan, Mali, Mozambique, the Philippines, Somalia, South Africa, Sudan, Syria, Ukraine, Venezuela and Yemen, have all been added as priority countries (p.36). However, the NAP notes that the list will be “dynamic and can be adjusted as conditions change” (p.36). As a divergence from all previous NAPs, Norway’s fifth NAP has a section devoted specifically to women and climate, peace and security, where it commits to linking the women, peace and security and climate, peace and security agendas, and dealing with these as interconnected and cross-cutting issues (p.25). Additionally, Norway’s fifth NAP includes an emphasis on the need for the meaningful participation of women, addressing conflict-related sexual violence, the gendered impact of the climate crisis and gender sensitive responses to emergency planning and response systems. The NAP also states that Norway supports civil society both as a partner and an actor for change, noting the need to: include civil society in peace processes (p.10), bridge the gap between civil society and parties to negotiations (p.13), promote the participation of women human rights defenders and representatives of civil society at the Security Council (p.33), and exchange information and collaborate with civil society to implement the NAP (p.36). Norway’s NAP also states the importance of integrating a gender perspective into work on arms control and humanitarian disarmament (p.28), though does not expand on how and in what context, nor does it mention Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW). Norway is a major contributor to humanitarian aid, including being a contributing donor to the Women’s Peace and Humanitarian Fund, a global partnership that works to empower women in conflict zones and humanitarian crises. Norway is also a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies, a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. In 2022, Norway was UN Women’s fourth-largest contributor, with $29.86million . Norway does not have a history of recent armed conflict, but is involved in international peacekeeping and overseas military operations. Standard policy in Norway is that the export of arms to states engaged in war is banned. However, as of January 1 2024, the Norwegian government has permitted direct sales of weapons and defense-related products to Ukraine. Additionally, the Norwegian government owns 64% of weapons manufacturer, Nammo.",1981,2,2014,8.38B,"NAP Development  
The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Justice and Public Security, the Ministry of Culture and Equality, the Ministry of Labour and Social Inclusion, and the Ministry of Climate and Environment (p.6).  The NAP also indicates that Norwegian and international civil society organizations, as well as Norwegian research institutes and other relevant experts, provided input and advice throughout the NAP’s development (p.6).  
NAP Implementation  
The NAP states that implementation will take place at national, bilateral, regional and multilateral levels, with a variety of actors for each level. It states that regional and multilateral forums will be given priority, which include NATO, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), the EU, the Council of Europe, the African Union, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the UN (p.36), though it does not outline how these organizations contribute to implementation. Similarly, the NAP also adds that cooperation, competence building and exchange of information with civil society organizations and research institutes will be key in implementation, but it does not outline in what capacity. At the national level, multiple ministries are listed as responsible for various goals of the NAP, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Justice and Public Security, Ministry of Culture and Equality, Ministry of Labour and Social Inclusion, and the Ministry of Climate and Environment.  
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation  
There is no specific section about monitoring and evaluation of the NAP, unlike the previous NAP, which specified indicators and a results framework. However, the responsible national ministries previously mentioned will, according to the most recent NAP, report annually on their implementation of the NAP.  Civil society is not mentioned in relation to monitoring. 
WILPF 
WILPF Norway is part of an umbrella-organization which organizes women’s civil society, FOCUS. Part of this organization you will find in the group Forum 1325. This group is in direct connection with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and there has been a continuing communication between the Ministry and the group in working with the NAP. 
WILPF Norway, or Internasjonal Kvinneliga for Fred og Frihet (IKFF), was founded in 1915 when various Norwegian women’s organizations sent representative delegates to the first WILPF Congress in the Hague. Throughout its history, WILPF Norway has been involved in numerous anti-war protests and has been an important advocate for mediation in international conflicts and the development of peace education and peace studies.  
Today, WILPF Norway continues to be part of initiatives at the national level, in particular against the Norwegian membership of NATO and reclaiming the United Nations as the primary international peace organization. The Section has also been actively campaigning against the inclusion of women in military service and taken a significant role in advocating the banning of nuclear weapons. WILPF Norway also works to raise awareness about UNSCR 1325 and has participated in its wider implementation, pressing the Norwegian Government to further its efforts for peace mediation.","The implementation period for Norway’s fifth NAP is longer than previous ones - it is seven instead of four years (2023-2030). In the NAP, this longer timeframe is said to give more predictability and encourage a long-term strategic approach to integrated implementation of the WPS agenda (p.36).  ","The 2023-2030 NAP identifies its main objective as being the promotion of sustainable peace and security at the national, regional and global level. It is also stated that an intersectional gender perspective must be integrated into this work, which underlies the three thematic priorities that are identified in the NAP. These include: 
Peace processes and implementation of peace agreements 
Promoting inclusive peace processes and working to encourage more participation of women 
Ensuring a good gender balance in delegations 
Taking a strategic approach to promoting gender issues in negotiations and building bridges between civil society and parties to negotiations 
Contributing to the protection of women peacebuilders and human rights defenders

Palestine,"Palestine adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in for the period 2017-2019. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Women’s Affairs as the head of the Higher National Committee for the Implementation of UNSCR 1325 and integrates the directions of the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) Advocacy Strategy, which was developed by the National Coalition for Implementing UNSCR 1325 in 2015. Palestine adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) for the period 2020-2024.  Development was led by ​​the Ministry of Women’s Affairs (MoWA), in close consultation with members of the National Committee for the Implementation of UNSCR 1325.  This NAP focuses on four pillars: prevention and protection; accountability; participation; relief and recovery.  Palestine’s second NAP echoes its first in protecting women and girls from the impacts of occupation and conflict, holding the Israeli occupation accountable, and enhancing the participation of Palestinian women in local and international decision-making processes.  It also responded to changing priorities such as the need to include interventions focusing on women and girls in the Jordan Valley and other areas affected by Israeli annexation, as well as women’s participation in COVID-19 recovery and rehabilitation efforts. Palestine reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64. Specifically, Palestine provided the following updates, among others: Commitments related to women, peace, and security have been integrated in frameworks of policies, planning and monitoring at national level and inter-ministerial levels. (p. 57) The Council of Ministers approved the National Strategic Framework for Resolution 1325. The Ministry of Women’s Affairs in August 2016, through the National Committee for the Implementation of Resolution 1325, launched the National Implementation Plan for Implementation of Resolution 1325. To integrate the commitments of women, peace and security into policy and planning frameworks, the Council of Ministers issued clear instructions to all Government institutions to integrate the activities of the Executive Plan of Resolution 1325 into the programmes of the relevant ministries. (p. 57) Capacity of service providers has been built on how to deal with cases of affected women. For example, 200 service providers (75 in the Ministry of Interior, 100 in the Ministry of Health and 25 in the Ministry of Social Development) were trained out of 375 planned during the implementation years of the plan. Fifty employees of the security establishment were trained on the concept of the decision and the mechanism of integration in the plans, programmes and budgets for implementation purposes. Another 50 people were trained on the mechanism of documenting violations of the occupation such as abuse of women and children. Twenty five employees of social service providers were trained on dealing with women victims of occupation violence. (p. 59) Palestine has been under long-lasting Israeli occupation , including several waves of military and political aggression, beginning with the 1948 war to the 1967 occupation of the West Bank and Gaza as well as the settlement building and the ongoing instability across the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Over 5.1 million Palestinians live under Israeli occupation, with increasing threats of mass evictions in areas such as Sheikh Jarrah. The occupation has had a disproportionate impact on women as well as spillover effects, with Palestinian refugees living in neighboring countries, including Lebanon and Jordan.",2014,,,,"NAP Development
Development of the NAP was led by the Ministry of Women’s Affairs (MoWA).  Members of the Higher National Committee for the Implementation of UNSCR 1325 (HNC) were involved in consultative steps on methodology and objectives, including sessions, workshops and working groups of governmental and civil society members that work on implementation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  The Ministry of Women’s Affairs reviewed the plan to assess the Ministry’s capacity, potential and achievements in planning and implementation.
NAP Implementation
The Higher National Committee for the Implementation of UNSCR 1325 (HNC), is composed of ministry, media and civil society members such as the Office of the President, the Cabinet secretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Diaspora, the Public Authority for Radio and Television, Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, General Union of Palestinian Women, Women’s Centre for Legal Aid and Counselling (WCLAC), Palestinian Working Women’s Association, and the head of the Advisory Committee on Gender in the security sector. HNC is chaired by MoWA and several organizations from the Gaza Strip were included as experts. 
Palestine’s NAP will be implemented by members of the HNC, as well as members of the Feminist Civil Society Coalition for the Implementation of 1325 (led by the General Union of Palestinian Women); various ministries, national coalitions working on combatting violence against women and supporting women’s political and social empowerment; Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), academic and research organizations, and civil society organizations in the West Bank and Gaza including feminist organizations, human rights organizations, and grassroots youth and women-led organizations.
NAP monitoring and evaluation
The HNC will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the NAP.",The implementation period for Palestine’s NAP is five years (2020-2024).,"The NAP focuses on four pillars:
Prevention and protection: protecting Palestinian women from the impacts of Israeli occupation and enhancing human security of women and girls, including physical safety, economic security, and physical and mental health.
Accountability: creating opportunities and spaces to hold Israel accountable for its incessant violations of the rights of Palestinian women, and ending the policy of impunity.
Participation: highlighting the role of women and girls at the local, regional and international levels, and ensuring their rights to participate in decision-making in accordance with the legal obligations, such as International Humanitarian Law.
Relief and recovery: gender mainstreaming within relief, humanitarian action and early recovery efforts; ensuring Palestinian women and girls a protective environment with rapid access to humanitarian aid, and the ability to lead and participate in the recovery and reconstruction efforts.
Each pillar focuses on main outcomes, each with a corresponding set of outputs (p. 21-24). For example, the second pillar of Accountability includes “Outcome 2.2: International and regional support mobilized to hold the Israeli occupation accountable for its violations of Palestinian women’s rights”, with three outputs including “Output 2.2.1: The various UN agencies and bodies are more aware of the gendered impact of the occupation on Palestinian women” (p. 22).","A set of activities or interventions has been allocated to each output as part of a Strategic Results Framework (p.25-34).
For example, under the first pillar of Prevention and Protection, Output 1.1.1 “Early warning system and conflict and gender-based violence prevention services are available to Palestinian women and girls” includes five activities, such as “Develop awareness-raising programmes to change stereotypes and behaviors that encourage gender-based violence, while engaging men and boys in prevention efforts” (p. 25).","The Strategic Results Framework also assigns each outcome, as well as each output, a set of indicators (p.25-34).
For example, under the fourth pillar of Relief and Recovery, Output 4.1.2 “Women’s capability to participate in national planning and crisis response (including the COVID-19 pandemic) is strengthened” includes two indicators (p. 33):
 Indicator 4.1.2.1: Number of women who participate in trainings focused on national response to crises
Indicator 4.1.2.2: Number of interventions that seek to promote women’s participation in relief and crisis response.","Through the coordination of its members, the HNC is responsible for both overseeing and monitoring the implementation of the NAP.  Its membership consists of a variety of both governmental and non-governmental organizations.
Whilst the NAP includes a Strategic Results Framework, its indicators remain relatively broad.  For instance, under Pillar three, Output 3.1.5 “Palestinian women’s capacity to represent Palestine in the United Nations bodies and international missions related to peace and security is strengthened” includes one indicator, “Percentage of women representation in Palestinian diplomatic missions” (p. 31).  However, it does not specify a target number nor percentage.","The NAP does not currently have a budget.  However, it includes a section entitled “Next Steps” (p. 35).  Here, it outlines that the Ministry of Women’s Affairs, as the Chair of the Higher National Committee, will collaborate with members of the HNC and key WPS actors, such as the UNSCR 1325 Civil Society Coalition, in an NAP costing exercise to create a costing and budgeting template.  This will include consultations with member states and donors, and provides an opportunity for dialogue about what resources are available and what the organizations and institutions involved can contribute.
Once this process is completed, the Ministry of Women’s Affairs and international partners will collaborate to create a NAP pooled funding mechanism, in order to leverage the contributions of multiple donors.",Disarmament is not addressed within Palestine’s NAP.
Paraguay,"Paraguay launched its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2015. The NAP was created to establish a framework, strategies, and actions for coordinated implementation of UNSCR 1325. The Action Plan was the result of joint efforts between different national institutions in the framework of a Specific Agreement of Inter-institutional Cooperation signed between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Women, the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Interior, and the Command of the Military Forces of Paraguay. The Action Plan includes four guiding principles: Equal Rights; Gender Equality; Participatory Democracy; and Comprehensiveness. Civil society is only briefly mentioned in the monitoring of the NAP.  The NAP aims at the elimination of cultural barriers that hinder the full participation of women in all aspects related to negotiations and resolution of conflicts, peace and security at the national level. There is no allocated budget or financing plan for objectives set out in the NAP.  The NAP also does not address disarmament issues or connect the proliferation of weapons with women’s insecurity. Paraguay does not have a recent history of conflict. The National Action Plan has an internal focus, and it aims at eliminating all the cultural barriers that prevent women from participating in all societal spheres.

Incorporate a gender perspective in all areas related to peace processes and conflict resolution;
Promote peace culture to prevent conflicts, with an active women’s participation;
Establish an effective coordination at the interinstitutional, intersectional and international level in order to develop joint actions, and to implement and evaluate UNSCR 1325.","Each four short-term goals have different actions assigned.

Peru’s NAP does not present concrete actions or activities for Prevention or Protection and instead they introduce a brief paragraph with an overview of each pillar. However, there is no coherence between the general objectives of the Plan and the following pillars. 

Prevention
This area consists of increasing the number of people who are trained in Women’s Empowerment and Gender Analysis, as well as increasing the number of hours of training for Peace Operations with a gender perspective, conflict prevention and peace processes. On the other hand, Peru will seek to increase the number of academic articles and academic events on Women, Peace and Security to ensure a wider education on the topic. 

Protection 
This area consists of strengthening and expanding measures to guarantee the security, physical and mental integrity, sexual and reproductive health, well-being, economic autonomy and dignity of women and girls; in respecting and guaranteeing the full exercise of the human rights of women and girls, incorporating the gender perspective in the institutions that play a role in peace, conflict and post-conflict operations.","For each objective and subsequent action the NAP contains a plan with specific indicators. For example, for the first objective of “incorporating a gender perspective to the responsible entities for the management of peace and security of the Defense Sector”, an indicator is the number of people who are trained in gender and women empowerment. This information can be found pages 13-16. ","For monitoring and evaluation, Peru requires an intersectoral coordination, which contains the Committee for Gender Equality of the Ministry of Defense. This committee integrates other institutions that aim to implement and monitor the proposes, objectives, and activities of the Action Plan. On this topic, the NAP recommends that even though it is limited to the scope of the Ministry of Defense, gender policy should be transversal to other public policies, in which case the Presidency of the Council of Ministers should be able to integrate other sectors in the design, implementation and monitoring of the purposes of UNSCR 1325. For this reason, for the process of monitoring and evaluation, other institutions are to be integrated, such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Women and Vulnerable Populations, the MInistry of the Interior and the Ministry of Justice, among others that are not mentioned explicitly.","The NAP does not detail the process of budgeting, however, there is a note on the document which reads: “Each institution included in the implementation of this NAP must include in its annual budget an item destined to the financing of the activities that correspond to them”.",There are no specific actions related to disarmament in the Peruvian NAP.

The 2017-2022 NAP was developed by the NSC WPS Technical Working Group (TWG) through a participatory approach that included consultations with civil society organizations. The NAP’s overall goal is to ensure the expansion of women’s role in the various spaces for peace and security. In this regard, it highlights women’s agency, both as leaders and participants, in the peace process of the country. It seeks to continue the best practice of women’s presence in formal peace negotiations as well as in other informal spaces (i.e., civil society and grassroots participation). The NAP does not have a detailed monitoring and evaluation framework, but identifies monitoring and evaluation among the NAP’s standalone pillars and objectives. While the NAP does not have an allocated budget, a subsequent executive order allocated approximately 100,000 USD to fund the first year of implementation. The Philippines’ second NAP is preceded by one other NAP, adopted in 2010 and implemented for the period 2010-2016. The country’s second NAP takes off from the findings of the study on the implementation of the 2010-2016 NAP, specifically, building on its gains and addressing the gaps. It adopts a broader framing of addressing the situation of women in armed conflict and recognising their contributions to peacebuilding. The NAP also incorporates some key recommendations made in the 2015 Global Study on UNSCR 1325 such as the prioritisation of conflict prevention; framing women peace and security from a human rights perspective; participation and leadership of women in all levels of the peace project; transitional justice; inclusive and participatory localisation efforts; combating extremism by supporting women peacebuilders; multi-level and multi-stakeholder approach to implementation; and financing initiatives aimed at materialising women, peace and security. The Philippines gained independence from the United States in 1946, having been ruled as a US territory prior to that date. The country has a history of intermittent armed conflicts with various insurgent groups, specifically involving the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) and the National Democratic Front (NDF). Since 2016, under the presidency of Rodrigo Duterte, the country has experienced grave human rights violations, specifically through Duterte’s “war against drugs,” which has resulted in widespread extrajudicial killings perpetrated by state security forces. Additionally, ongoing rights violations include threats against and direct attacks on human rights defenders, political activists, and environmental and community leaders. In 2019, the United Nations Human Rights Council adopted a resolution , which requests the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to provide a report on the human rights situation in the Philippines.",1981,16,2013,3.4B,,The implementation period for the National Plan of Action is six years (2017-2022).,"The four support pillars of the Philippines' NAP include:
Empowerment and Participation;
Protection and Prevention;
Promotion and Mainstreaming;
Monitoring and Evaluation.","Each area of work has different actions assigned. For example, Support Pillar 1 (Empowerment and Participation) includes the following action points:
Sex-and-conflict disaggregation of data practiced by relevant agencies;
Existing M&E mechanisms harmonised;
Creation of a NAP WPS data-base;
Inter-link Country Reports on CEDAW, BPFA, WPS, SDG 16 specific to women in conflict-situations and peacebuilding, peacekeeping, and peacemaking as well as conflict prevention, resolutions, and transformation;

Report on Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) support for NAP WPS initiatives."," Each action point includes a number of indicators that ranges depending on the action points. For example, Action Point 10 (Preventive mechanisms and early warning systems in place for women and girls to avert conflict-related violence) includes the following indicators:
Initiatives on gender, peace, security, and human rights aimed at building an enabling environment for peace through formal, nonformal,indigenous/cultural education supported;
Capacities of women on community-based early warning protocols and monitoring at the grassroots level developed;
Initiatives to address the proliferation of small arms and light weapons, including in the context of peace agreements (i.e. normalisation; end of hostilities, disposition of firearms, disarmament, demobilisation, and reintegration) are strengthened.
 ","As a stand-alone priority, the “Monitoring and Evaluation” Pillar prioritises the institutionalisation of a comprehensive and systematic M & E mechanism for NAP WPS, including through the following indicators:
Sex-and-conflict disaggregation of data practiced by relevant agencies;
Existing M&E mechanisms harmonised;
Creation of a NAP WPS data base;
Inter-link Country Reports on CEDAW, BPFA, WPS, SDG 16 specific to women in conflict-situations and peacebuilding, peacekeeping, and peacemaking as well as conflict prevention, resolutions, and transformation;

Poland,"Poland adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2018 for the period 2018-2021, and then updated this NAP to extend it until 2023. Analysis below reflects the 2018-2021 original version and will be updated soon. The 2018-2021 NAP was developed by a number of ministries, including the Ministries of Foreign Affairs; National Defence; and Interior and Administration, as well as the Government Plenipotentiary for Equal Treatment, through a participatory process that included public consultations with non-governmental organizations. The NAP has four major objectives that focus on the need to increase women’s participation in peace processes, peacekeeping missions and operations; the need to strengthen women’s role in decision-making processes related to ensuring peace; and the need to protect and support women and children in conflict and in post-conflict settings. The implementation of activities set out in the document will be financed from the budgets of the relevant participating ministries and from the budgets of  their subordinate units, academic centers, think-tanks and non‑governmental organizations. Poland does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but is a contributor to overseas military operations and peacekeeping missions. In 2020, Poland announced that the country will be withdrawing from the Istanbul Convention, a Council of Europe treaty to prevent domestic violence and violence against women. At the multilateral level, Poland most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2018-2019.",1980,40,2014,11.9B,"NAP Development

Portugal,"Portugal adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2019 for the period 2019-2022. Portugal’s third National Action Plan (NAP) is the result of the evaluation of the previous Action Plan, which provided recommendations for structuring the new NAP. Through this document, the Lisbon government recognizes gender equality and non-discrimination as a constitutional, ethical and legal imperative and seeks to incorporate the gender perspective in the different areas of public policy, particularly in diplomatic, military, security, justice and development cooperation activities; moreover, the NAP defines how Portugal incorporates the UNSCR 1325 on the national, regional and international fronts. The NAP is aligned with Portugal’s diverse international commitments, including in the European Council, the European Union and the Community of Portuguese Speaking Countries, and complies with the European Council for the Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (Istanbul Convention). Portugal’s third NAP is preceded by two other NAPs, adopted in 2009 and 2014 and implemented for the period 2009-2013 and 2014-2018, respectively. The first NAP approaches the implementation of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda mostly internationally, identifying the goal to “promot[e] the inclusion of the dimension of gender equality at all stages of peacebuilding processes and the promotion of safety” (p. 5). As such, there is a strong emphasis on women’s inclusion in peacekeeping missions and peacebuilding efforts among the NAP’s objectives. The NAP does not have a detailed monitoring and implementation framework, nor does it include an allocated budget. The second NAP was developed through a participatory approach that included a public consultation as well as an independent external evaluation of the country’s first NAP. Nevertheless, the content of the first NAP’s objectives remain mostly unchanged in the second NAP, even though the revised action plan has a more detailed implementation matrix. Portugal plays a role in international peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts. Portugal is a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies , a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. In 2019, Portugal was among the top 25 arms exporters in the world. At the multilateral level, Portugal most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2011-2011, and is currently a candidate for a non-permanent member seat for the period 2027-2028.",1980,,2014,4.7B,"Development

Republic Of Congo Brazzaville,,,,,,"As the primary government entity focused on women, The Ministry for the Promotion of Women and the Integration of Women in Development plays a critical role; it is in charge of the coordination among all the actors involved in the NAP and must ensure the implementation of the plan. 
Development
For the development of the Republic of Congo’s NAP, participatory consultations were organized, and more than 40 people in public administration, civil society, political parties, and religious denominations worked together to discuss the strategic axes of the NAP and all its related activities.
In addition, an updating workshop was held to critically analyze the current situation of women with regards to political representation and participation in decision-making positions. This workshop was attended by 70 people who represented national institutions, key ministries, civil society organizations working with women and youth, religious denominations, and United Nations personnel. 
Implementation
Different actors are responsible for the implementation of the NAP at the national, regional, and local levels. The implementation process is led by the Steering Committee, which is the coordination and decision-making body chaired by the Prime Minister. The Steering Committee is composed of representatives of the ministries related to human rights and gender-based violence in particular, including education, health, defense, finance, social affairs, and women. It is responsible for the mobilization of the resources, the examination and validation of the reports, and the half-yearly and annual work plans. 
The National Coordinating Committee is led by the Ministry for the Promotion of Women and the Integration of Women to Development and is an executive body within the Steering Committee. It is responsible for ensuring that a gender perspective is considered in all national policies. It includes representatives of CSOs who support the implementation of the NAP, and is assisted by a Technical Secretariat and experts on data collection, information, education and communication, communication for behavior change, support and decision making, and survivors and perpetrators of violence.
Departmental Coordination is ensured by the Prefect, and assisted by the Departmental Director for the Advancement of Women; it has the same attributes as the National Coordinating Committee at a reduced level and meets three times per year. It is composed of the Mayor of the urban community, the Departmental directors of the ministries, members of the Steering Committee, CSOs representatives in the Department, and technical and financial partners.
There are also UNSCR1325 Units, which are chaired by the Heads of Districts and the Administrators and Mayors of the arrondissements and are in charge of the NAP implementation at the district and commune level. They have the same attributes and composition as the Departmental Coordination mechanism at a more reduced level, and meet every month.
Monitoring and Evaluation 
The National Coordinating Committee’s Technical Secretariat, headed by a Gender Focal Point, is responsible for monitoring and evaluation of the NAP. This process will include assessment of the annual workplans at the national, sectoraal, departmental, municipal, and district levels, and is designed to ensure that further adjustments can be made if necessary to ensure implementation.
Civil Society
According to the text of the Republic of Congo’s NAP,  the participation of civil society organizations at all levels is promoted, and the NAP reports that civil society was part of the participatory consultations and the updating workshop. In addition, the NAP recognizes the need to empower women and girls to participate in civil society and public life and advocates for the creation of CSOs working on women and girls' rights, particularly regarding the WPS agenda. Therefore, in line with axis no. 1, the NAP outlines an activity for the creation of a permanent Executive Secretariat from CSOs to work with the Ministry for the Promotion of Women and the Integration of Women in Development in the monitoring of the implementation of the NAP and UNSCR 1325 (2000) in the Republic of Congo. In addition, this Executive Secretariat will help enable information exchange and collaboration between CSOs, as well as training on WPS.",The timeframe for the implementation of the NAP is set for the fourth quarter of 2021 until December 2023.,"The Republic of Congo’s NAP is organized through five strategic axes, under which different actions are outlined. These axes have secondary objectives to ensure a holistic and focused implementation of the WPS agenda throughout the country. 
Coordination, financing, monitoring, and evaluation of the implementation of the NAP

Axis 5) organize campaigns on the importance of the participation and representation of women in humanitarian action, recovery, and DDR efforts, and advocate with decision-makers to take gender into account in the development and budgeting of management mechanisms for humanitarian action","Due to the diversity of activities proposed, there are multiple indicators to measure the effectiveness of implementation efforts. Some of these include: 
Amounts pledged for the financing of the NAP, as a result of the fundraising strategy to finance the implementation of NAP 
The number and types of trainings provided
The number of policies and laws revised, initiated, passed, and promulgated, as a result of the actions focused on including the gender perspective in the Republic of Congo legal system. 
The number of recommendations followed by the Government, the result of studies and analysis focused on the situation of women and girls in the Republic of Congo

The number of awareness campaigns on the UNSCR 1325","The National Coordinating Committee and the Technical Secretariat are in charge of developing and implementing an M&E plan to evaluate the expected results of each secondary objective.
The monitoring comprises two components: administrative monitoring and the programmatic and technical monitoring. The administrative monitoring is done at the coordination level (national and departmental) and tracks the administrative coordination of the actions of the NAP, the execution of actions by the sectoral technical directorates of the ministries that are members of the Steering Committee, and produces quarterly reports and proposes adjustments and improvements. The programmatic and technical monitoring tracks the execution of actions planned, undertaken and the resources allocated for this purpose, and the impact assessment. The UNSCR 1325 Focal Point oversees the production and publication of progress reports or quarterly supervisions, and a technical and financial report is to be transmitted to the Coordination.
There will be an annual assessment, mid-term evaluations, and also a final evaluation of the NAP. In addition, the evaluators will hold regular meetings with key stakeholders to feed into these assessments.","The Ministry for the Promotion of Women and the Integration of Women in Development, as the main actor responsible for the NAP, has a state operating budget.
 The Executive Secretariat is funded through subsidies and/or donations from public and private entities, national or international bodies, and aid funds granted by partners. 
The NAP estimates that the total budget between October 2021 and December 2023 will be XOF 3,100,000,000 for all activities, with the breakdown as follows:
Pillar 1: XOF 640,000,000
Pillar 2: XOF 1,600,000,000
Pillar 3: XOF 495,000,000
Pillar 4: XOF 305,000,000","The fourth pillar and the fifth axis of the NAP are focused on demobilization, disarmament and reintegration (DDR) and they seek to include the gender perspective on such programs, promote and increase the participation of women and girls as agents of change in DDR efforts, and include their needs and experiences in security sector reform at all levels, particularly the perspectives of women officers, former combatants, and women and girls associated with armed groups. 
Actions in this regard include: awareness campaigns on the importance of participation and representation of women in humanitarian action, recovery and DDR, advocating to include a gender perspective in the development and budgeting of mechanisms for humanitarian action, create a mechanism to improve the physical security and protection of displaced girls and women, involve CSOs in the development of policies and strategies for humanitarian interventions, and promote DDR programs with a gender perspective."
South Korea,"The Republic of Korea (ROK or South Korea) adopted its third National Action Plan (NAP) in 2021 for the period 2021-2023. It was preceded by two others. The third NAP aims to integrate gender perspectives in conflict prevention, peace, and unification, including in the peacebuilding on the Korean Peninsula, and international development cooperation, as well as to increase and strengthen women’s participation and international cooperation. Furthermore, it underscores the practical efforts needed to disseminate the global WPS agenda at the national and local levels, and envisages a structured mechanism for monitoring so as to ensure a more robust basis for implementation. The most recent armed conflict in the history of the ROK was the Korean War (1950-1953). The fighting was brought to a halt with the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement , which resulted in the creation of the Korean Demilitarized Zone (or DMZ), a strip of land dividing the Korean peninsula while also being the most heavily fortified border in the world. However, the Korean War has never been formally concluded with a peace agreement, a fact which has contributed to the ongoing instability in the region. Women activists have long called for an end to the political tension that has shaped the lives of Korean citizens for decades. Launched in 2019 by several women’s civil society organizations, including Women Cross DMZ, Nobel Women’s Initiative, Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) and the Korean Women’s Movement for Peace, Korea Peace Now is a global advocacy campaign working towards the establishment of sustainable peace on the Korean Peninsula through an inclusive peace agreement. In addition to this collective advocacy effort, women activists have also been demanding justice for women who survived sexual slavery (euphemistically referred to as “ comfort women ”) perpetrated during World War II by the Japanese Imperial Army. In 2019, South Korea was among the top 10 military spenders as well as among the top 10 arms exporters in the world. Additionally, South Korea enforces mandatory military service for all able-bodied men between the age of 18 and 28. At the multilateral level, South Korea most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2013-2014.",1984,108,2016,44B,"The Ministry of Education (MOE), Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA), Ministry of Unification (MOU), Ministry of Justice (MOJ), Ministry of National Defense (MND), Ministry of the Interior and Safety (MOIS), the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), the Korean National Police Agency (KNPA) and the  National Unification Advisory Council (NUAC) are the main actors involved in the NAP.
Development
For the third NAP cycle, the National Unification Advisory Council (NUAC), a presidential consultative body, participated. Led and coordinated by MOGEF as the main ministry in charge, the third NAP (2021-2023) was drawn up through close collaboration among ten government ministries and agencies, including the MOE, MOFA, MOU, MOJ, MND, MOIS, KNPA, KOICA and NUAC.
Implementation
In order to ensure effective implementation of the third NAP, the Republic of Korea established a mechanism to monitor the implementation, and set up a civic advisory panel to promote broader public-private governance cooperation, involving relevant civil society organizations, academia, and experts. To be more specific, the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family convenes an Implementation Monitoring meeting annually, with the participation of each implementing ministry and agency and the civic advisors, the results of which is reported to the Gender Equality Committee established in accordance with the Framework Act on Gender Equality. Taking a step further, each implementing ministry and agency is expected to conduct its own Implementation Monitoring meeting once a year in the presence of external experts to ensure more in-depth stocktaking. This is intended for the ministries and agencies to devise their own practical measures for implementation and improvement aligned with the attributes and expertise specific to their work. Also, each implementing body establishes its own Implementation Monitoring system, taking into account its distinctive characteristics.
Monitoring
The ROK's third NAP, after three years from its launch, will be re-examined and revised in terms of its overall objectives, strategies, andaction plans through consultations among government ministries, relevant stakeholders and civil society.",The implementation period for the South Korean NAP is three years (2021-2023).,"The ROK's third NAP comprises of 11 objectives and 24 strategies in five areas: Prevention, Participation, Protection, Relief and Recovery, andImplementation Monitoring.

Romania,"Romania adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2014 for the period 2014-2024. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Defense and focuses on implementation of the WPS agenda in the context of defense policy. The NAP does not identify civil society inclusion in the NAP development process. Romania’s NAP contextualizes the WPS agenda by providing an overview of legislative landmarks pertaining to the advancement of women’s rights at the domestic level. The NAP focuses heavily on increasing the number of women within the military and its scope focuses on this and related objectives. Furthermore, the NAP does not include an allocated budget. In 2020, Romania adopted a more holistic National Action Plan for the period 2020-2023. Analysis of this plan is forthcoming . Romania transitioned into a democratic regime in 1989, after an extensive period under communist rule. Romania does not have a recent history of armed conflict. However, the country has had a tense relationship with its ethnic Hungarian population, which resulted in violent clashes between Romanians and ethnic Hungarians in the Transylvanian city of Târgu Mureș in 1990. A former member of NATO’s Partnership for Peace Program , Romania officially joined NATO in 2004. At the multilateral level, Romania most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2004-2005.",1982,55,2015,4.9B,"A number of actors are listed in the beginning of the NAP as being the key actors involved, specifically: the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Romanian Intelligence Service, the Special Telecommunication Service, the Protection and Guard Service, the National Agency for Equal Opportunities between women and men, the National Administration of Penitentiaries, the National University of Political and Administrative Studies, the Civil organization non-profit FRONT, and the Mediation Council.
There is a National Implementation Group which is responsible for implementing the NAP and monitoring its implementation. 
The fourth objective of the NAP is to facilitate cooperation with civil society in the process of implementing the WPS agenda. Under this objective, there are several activities and indicators regarding developing partnerships with NGOs and creating a permanent consultative process with civil society and academia.
The monitoring of the NAP’s implementation will be done by the National Implementation Group, which includes representatives from the following institutions: Ministry of National Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Romanian Intelligence Service, Special Telecommunication Service, Protection and Guard Service, National Agency for Equal Opportunities between women and men and National Administration of Penitentiaries. The NAP states that this group will also cooperate with other actors including parliamentarians and civil society. The Gender Management Office is the Secretariat of this group.
 ",The NAP will be implemented for the period 2020-2023.,"The National Action Plan grounds itself within the context of the WPS resolutions and the pillars of the agenda, as well as other frameworks in the EU and NATO. It also contextualizes itself within the history of Romania’s domestic work on women’s rights, including CEDAW and national strategies on gender equality, as well as the Ministry of National Defense’s Plan for the Implementation of UNSCR 1325 (2014-2024).
It states that its main goal is to create the “basis for a series of common policies and directives for the implementation of UNSCR 1325 (2000) used by the institutions of the national defence, public order and national defence system of Romania, as well as other central administration institutions with responsibilities in this field”. 
There are four main objectives of the NAP: Integration of gender perspective in security and defence policies; Increase the representation and significant participation of women in peace negotiations, mediation processes and within peace keeping missions; Prevent and combat all forms of gender based discrimination, harassment and sexual violence; and Cooperation with the civil society in the process of implementing the WPS agenda.
 ","Chapter 4 of the NAP contains a series of concrete activities, with deadlines, responsible ministries or actors, financial resources, and indicators. Examples of planned activities include:
Construction of a common database regarding WPS specialists in the national defence, public order and national security systems, academic environment and civilian community
Elaborate an SOP regarding the reporting and response mechanism with regards to the incidents that involve sexual exploitation and abuse committed by Romanian military and civilian personnel deployed abroad
Introduce training programmes regarding gender equality in all academic institutions of the security and defence sectors","The NAP reports on existing efforts to promote the participation of women in different aspects of peace and security through detailed statistics over time.
Under Chapter 4 of the NAP, there is a table with planned activities and associated indicators. Indicators include: 
Training the forces prior to deployment for peace keeping missions regarding the protection and support of sexual and gender violence victims, as well as how to report such cases
Conduct at least one training per semester regarding prevention and combating sexual harassment and discrimination
Periodically create and update WPS study materials as well as academic curriculum based on Resolution 1325(2000)","The NAP contains a monitoring and evaluation framework in Chapter 5. Monitoring and evaluation will be conducted by a dedicated implementation group (see above), which will include civil society.
All institutions that are part of the national implementation group will submit annual reports regarding the implementation of the NAP. There will be a half-term evaluation of the NAP in the second quarter of 2022, and the secretariat will analyze the results and propose updates and amendments to the NAP.

Rwanda,"Rwanda adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2018 for the period 2018-2022. The NAP was developed by a Steering Committee, which was composed of ten ministries, in consultation with civil society members, including women’s organizations. The NAP is organized under five overarching pillars: participation and leadership of women in decision-making; prevention of violence against women and involvement in conflict prevention; protection from violence; equal access to means of relief, economic recovery and rehabilitation; and women’s promotion and gender mainstreaming in Rwanda’s foreign service and international and regional cooperation. Each objective has corresponding actions, indicators, and a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation framework, but the NAP does not have an allocated budget. Rwanda’s second NAP is preceded by one other NAP adopted in 2009 and implemented for the period 2009-2012. Rwanda’s second NAP builds on an evaluation of and lessons learned from the implementation of the previous NAP, which provided a post-conflict framework to the country for women’s participation in peace and security processes and the fight against sexual and gender-based violence. The NAP takes a close look at the incremental gains achieved as a result of concerted efforts to implement UNSCR 1325 and the WPS agenda in Rwanda as well as challenges that continue to face the country in addressing women’s meaningful participation in all facets of life, the occurrence of sexual and gender based violence, and access to resources. Unlike the first Rwandan NAP, where a set of timeframes for specific activities were included in the budget, and was generally one of the most detailed budgets found among NAPs, the second NAP does not provide a budget within the plan. Rwanda reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country reported that women represent 44.3% of community mediators and 48% of the access to Justice Bureaus. It also reported on women’s involvement in disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration processes, including through grassroots cooperatives of women ex-combatants, but indicated that further work is needed to integrate women more fully into peace processes (p. 46). Rwanda gained independence in 1962 from Belgium, after decades of colonial rule. The most recent armed conflict in Rwanda’s history is the 1994 civil war, which resulted in a genocide where an estimated 800,000-1 million people, mostly the Tutsi minority, were killed by the majority Hutus. The war had a distinct gendered impact on women, as rape was systematically used as a weapon of war. The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) was established in 1994 to prosecute the perpetrators of the genocide, and for the first time in international law, the court recognized sexual violence as a component of genocide. The Rwandan government placed particular emphasis on post-conflict reconstruction in the aftermath of the war, with women playing a key role in recovery efforts. This concerted effort resulted in a constitution that implemented a mandatory 30% quota for women in elected positions. Today, Rwanda is a world leader in women’s political representation, with women holding over 60% of positions in the lower house. Despite this promising number, structural barriers still exist to women’s equal rights in daily life.",1981,9,,121M,"NAP Development
Rwandan civil society organisations, including women’s organisations participated in the creation and the development of the Regional Women's Forum (RWF) which was able to secure space for advocacy and to voice women’s issues in consultations. Civil society groups who continued to be involved as part of the Steering Committee in the development of the second generation NAP include: Femme/Twese Hamwe, Collectif et Ligue des Associations des Droits de l’Homme (a umbrella human rights coalition), Pro Femme Twese Hamwe, and the Center for Conflict Management. 
WILPF does not have a country section in Rwanda and was therefore not involved in the development of the NAP.
There is a Steering Committee comprised of ten ministries (including Forum of Rwandan Women Parliamentarians, National Women Council, National Unity and Reconciliation Commission, National Human Rights Commission, and Rwanda Demobilization and Reintegration Commission among others) tasked with overseeing the implementation of the NAP. 
NAP Implementation
Civil society participated in nationwide consultations with others (government representatives, research institutions, bilateral and multilateral partners) in the development of the NAP. There is also civil society representation in the Steering Committee for the implementation of the NAP. However, the chair of this committee is the head of the Ministry of Gender and Family Protection.
The Rwandan NAP assigns government ministries to specific activities. These include: Ministries of Gender and Family Promotion, and Local Administration, National Women Council, GMO, Rwandan Defense Forces, Forum of Rwandan Parliamentarians, and the ministries listed above and below.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
A Steering Committee is tasked with overseeing the monitoring and evaluation of the NAP. The document lists Pro-Femmes Twese Hamwe and CLADHO as the civil society organizations included on the Committee.
A Steering Committee tasked with overseeing the monitoring and evaluation process is comprised of the following ministries: Gender and Family Promotion; Foreign Affairs and East African Community; Local Government; Finance and Economic Planning; Education; Gender and Family Promotion; Health, and the Forum of Rwandan Women Parliamentarians.",The NAP is scheduled for implementation between 2018-2022 through various ministries and local and national levels.,"The current Rwandan NAP is organized into five pillar areas:  
Pillar I: Participation and Leadership of Women in Decision-making
Pillar II: Prevention of Violence against Women and Involvement in Conflict Prevention
Pillar III: Protection From Violence
Pillar IV: Equal Access to Means of Relief, Economic Recovery and Rehabilitation
Pillar V: Women’s Promotion and Gender Mainstreaming in Rwanda’s Foreign Service and International and Regional Cooperation
Each pillar has a stated commitment by the government and a set of objectives. For example, for Pillar II: Prevention of Violence against Women and Involvement in Conflict Prevention, the government committs to “improve intervention strategies in the prevention of violence against women, including engaging more substantially the community and especially men as well as strengthening community institutional capacities to prevent violence”. This is followed by a stated outcome: “Increased efforts in conflict and SGBV prevention at the local level set of objectives” and supported by a set of projected outputs: Increased public awareness on GBV issues; Improved accountability mechanisms for GBV at the local level; Gender responsive early warning and conflict prevention mechanisms established.",,"An indicator is given for each activity in the NAP. For example, under Pillar II - ""Prevention of Violence against Women and Involvement in Conflict Prevention” - the following indicators are given:
Number of women leaders trained and participating in building peace and security
The number of women in decision making organs is increased
Databank on women with experience in peace and security areas is available
The number of women who have been recruited or appointed to in peace and security positions
Number of women who have been trained in peace and security and the quality of that training
Number of infrastructures adapted to women’s conditions
A permanent framework of dialogue between grassroots women’s’ leaders for operational
Number of peace and security forums organized
Types of conflict prevention and conflict management partnerships formed
Number training participants and sessions for CNF and training manual","Yearly action plans are to be developed, monitored and reported on in relation to the NAP’s five pillars. The NAP also indicates a comprehensive M&E framework elaborated by National Technical Working Groups (TWGs) with clear indicators and milestones against which progress will be assessed. Regular monitoring will also enable stakeholders to update, improve and adapt the action plans as contexts change. The Ministry of Gender and Family Protection (MIGEPROF) is responsible for collating reports, and once data is collated, Friends of 1325 Group will meet on a quarterly basis to analyze progress against the set targets. The TWG are to meet once every quarter to discuss progress, challenges and bottlenecks, and suggest timely corrective measures based on RNAP progress reports. The Gender Monitoring Office, which is a member of the national gender machinery, is responsible for monitoring the implementation of international and regional commitments and will oversee review of progress against the stated pillar objectives. The government also plans to produce independent progress reports two years after the adoption of the RNAP and at the end of Plan timeline.","Unlike the previous Rwandan NAP, which covered the period 2009-2012, where a set of timeframes for specific activities were included in the budget, and was generally one of the most detailed budgets in terms of national action plans, this current NAP does not provide a budget (or a mention of it) within the plan.",The Rwandan NAP does not mention disarmament in any of its activities or scope for implementation.
Senegal,"The 2020-2024 NAP reflects the Senegalese government’s commitment to having a basic tool that harmonizes visions and coordinates the implementation of all actions that converge towards rights and needs of women and girls in peace, security and national reconciliation processes, with a particular emphasis on prevention.  The second-generation NAP aims to establish a diagnosis of the first action plan and to formulate new strategies and actions to be implemented under the new one. The second NAP R1325 aims to “Implement and ensure coordination and follow-up of UNSC Resolution 1325 and its follow-up at national level”. Its overall objective is to “Ensure better participation of women and girls of women and girls in the prevention and management of peace and security, as well as a better their specific needs in terms of protection and post-crisis recovery”. Senegal adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2011 for the period 2011-2015. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Gender through a participatory approach that included several ministries, including the Ministries of Family, Defense, Interior, Justice, Education, and Health, as well as civil society organizations, local groups, and universities. The Steering Committee, composed of government ministries, intergovernmental agencies, and civil society organisations, coordinates and monitors the NAP implementation. The NAP identifies three overarching objectives, based on the pillars of UNSCR 1325: prevention, participation, and relief and recovery. Each objective has corresponding actions and indicators, but the monitoring and evaluation framework consists primarily of reports to be submitted to the government every three months. The NAP includes an estimated budget. Senegal gained independence from France in 1960, after a long period of colonial rule under various European empires. The most recent armed conflict in the country’s history is the Casamance conflict , which has been ongoing since 1982. Women have been key players in the field of peacebuilding, especially through the establishment of the Platform of Women for Peace in Casamance in 2010. At the multilateral level, Senegal most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2016-2017.",1985,99,2014,349M,"The first NAP came to be after the 2010 Regional Forum, which was spearheaded by 11 Ministers of Women, Family and/or Family Affairs, with the participation of the African Union, UN System agencies and a diversity of civil society actors. This Forum had the goal to recommend the States to engage in the creation of their own action plans.  This resulted in the 2011-2015 NAP, elaborated by Senegal in the year following the Forum. 
In May 2015, Senegal carried out an evaluation with the support of UNOWAS, on the implementation of UNSCR 1325 in the country. The recommendations and new directions emphasized the formulation of a new action plan to promote the concrete materialization and consolidation of the Senegalese civil society’s potential for intervention in the field of peace and security. The second-generation NAP aims to establish a diagnosis of the first action plan and to formulate new strategies and actions to be implemented under the new one. 
The 2020-2024 NAP reflects the Senegalese government’s commitment to having a basic tool that harmonizes visions and coordinates the implementation of all actions that converge towards rights and needs of women and girls in peace, security and national reconciliation processes, with a particular emphasis on prevention.  
Implementation
The NAP2-R1325 will be implemented according to the Modality “National Execution”. The Ministry in charge of the implementation is the Ministry of Women, Family, Gender and Child Protection, through its Directorate of Equity and Gender Equality. 
The decision-making, orientation and monitoring bodies are made up of (i) the National Monitoring Committee (CNP in French), chaired by the Minister of Women, Family, Gender and Child Protection; (ii) the Restricted Committee (CR in French), chaired by the same Ministry; (iii) the Women, Peace and Security Working Group (GT/FPS) coordinated jointly by DEEG and the Steering Committee. The Secretariat of these bodies is provided by DEEG’s PAN-R1325 Specialized Unit (US/PAN-R1325).
US-NAP-R1325, located within the Gender Equity and Equality Department, is a team made up of a specialist in Gender, Peace and Security, a Monitoring and Evaluation Expert, an Administrative and Financial (RAF), a communications officer and a database manager. This team constitutes the national coordination staff, working independently from the civil servants members of the Steering Committee, which supervises and validates the activities of US/ NAP-R1325.
At local level, activities are carried out through the NAP-R1325 Regional Monitoring Committees (CRS/ NAP-R1325) chaired by regional governors, with secretarial support provided by the structure established by the Governor. The meeting is attended by all decentralized technical services, leaderships of relevant national projects and programs, and all CSOs, particularly women's CSOs active in the field of peace and security, and in promoting the rights and empowerment of women and girls. Following-up to NAP-R1325 will be on the agenda of the Comité Development Committee (CRD) by regional governors.
This system enables the development of a structuring partnership with ongoing collaboration with extension services, NGOs/CSOs, the private sector, projects, as well as the ministerial departments and programmes their intervention programs, with a view to ensuring synergy and greater efficiency and efficiency of interventions.",The implementation period for the Senegalese NAP is 2020-2024.,"The second NAP R1325 aims to ""Implement and ensure coordination and follow-up of UNSC Resolution 1325 and its follow-up at national level"". Its overall objective is to ""Ensure better participation of women and girls of women and girls in the prevention and management of peace and security, as well as a better their specific needs in terms of protection and post-crisis recovery"". It has five main components, each with a specific goal:
 Prevention: establish an integrated national mechanism for early warning and prevention of crises, conflicts and all threats to peace, particularly violent extremism, and to combat the insecurity of women and girls.
Protection: guarantee conditions of safety for women and girls at all times and in situations of crisis or conflict, against all forms of violence, particularly sexual or gender-based violence, by improving the services of the Justice, Police and Army to this end.
Participation and promotion: promote the representation and empowerment of women in the prevention, negotiation and peacekeeping mechanisms and processes of the and in diplomatic missions.
Post-crisis recovery/relief: supporting women and girls affected by crisis situations to help them reintegrate into the workforce, build their resilience and economic empowerment, and rebuilding or improving their living environment.
Coordination of the NAP2-R1325 implementation: Ensure the functionality of the coordination and monitoring-evaluation system for NAP2-R1325 et Suivantes, and ensure optimum human, financial and material resources required for its successful implementation.","For Senegal, there are a number of priority issues/actions that were appointed as the focus of the prevention strategy. These include:
The management of natural resources, due to the impact that they have in the stability of a country. According to the NAP2, plenty of the conflicts in the African continent are due to the control of natural resources, which results in violence and instability.
The easing of political tensions, with the implementation of R1325 providing a framework for harmonizing and expressing the will of the national women’s civil movement to play its full part in the restructuring of the political field in its various forms and mechanisms. This includes providing the circumstances for women to play their fundamental role as agents of change in new perspectives for the maintenance of peace.","Each strategic objective has a number of listed indicators. For example, “the easing of political tensions” includes providing the circumstances for women to play their fundamental role as agents of change in new perspectives for the maintenance of peace.","is to be carried out by the NAP steering team, or any other structure or set up for this purpose, under the supervision of the steering committee and with the ongoing collaboration of the Ministère de la Femme, de la Famille du Genre et de la protection des Enfants. The Steering Committee is responsible for organizing upstream M&E activities with a view to assessing the achievements in line with the standards and procedures defined by the MFFGPE and its partners. This M&E plan should thus contribute to defining methodological and technical procedures to assess and measure the successful implementation of this action plan.

 ",Senegal’s NAP does not discuss disarmament issues.
Serbia,"Serbia adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2017 for the period 2017-2020. The NAP was developed through a collaborative process that included representatives of public administration and local self-government bodies, academia, civil society organisations, and independent experts. The NAP takes into account the results of the evaluations of the implementation of the previous NAP, undertaken by civil society organisations. The NAP identifies five overarching objectives, including developing preventive mechanisms to protect women before, during, and after conflict as well as increasing women’s representation in all decision-making processes pertaining to peace and security. The NAP identifies corresponding actions and indicators as well as an allocated budget for each action identified. Serbia’s most recent NAP is preceded by one other NAP, adopted in 2010 and implemented for the period 2010-2015. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Defense. The NAP has seven key pillars focused on institutions; representation; decision-making; inclusion; protection; education; and media. In particular, the NAP focuses on increasing women’s representation in decision-making positions and processes within the defense and security sector; conflict resolution and post-conflict context; and in multinational operations. The NAP also emphasizes protecting women and girls from humans rights violations and gender-based violence. While the second NAP includes fewer pillars, focusing on actors, institutional bodies, and mechanisms; prevention; participation; protection; and recovery, the content of the overall objectives remains similar. Additionally, Serbia’s second NAP includes a dedicated section to review the challenges of implementing the first NAP, which include, among others, a general lack of awareness among local governments about Resolution 1325 and Serbia’s NAP. Additionally, the survey revealed that there were no women mayors among those surveyed, and no funds were allocated to the implementation of designated activities to implement the actions identified in the NAP. This survey was complemented by a civil society report, and led to public consultations for the drafting of the revised action plan. Serbia reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country provided the following update, among others: The Women, Peace and Security area is integrated into the National Gender Equality Strategy for the period from 2016 to 2020, which particularly emphasizes the importance of the active role of women in preserving peace and security, points to the consequences of armed conflict on women and girls and the importance of the active role of women in peacebuilding and the country’s post-conflict recovery. The area of Women, Peace and Security, i.e. the application of CEDAW’s General Recommendation No 30 is part of Serbia’s reporting to the CEDAW Committee. Moreover, the European Charter for Equality of Women and Men in Local Life signed by 73 municipalities, recognizes the need to develop local policies with the aim of improving security of women and men, especially safety and security in the local community and combating gender- based violence. (p. 66) Serbia became an independent state in 2006 after its peaceful separation from Montenegro, both of whom were previously part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The most recent history of armed conflict in Serbia’s history is the Yugoslav Wars (1991-1999), in which Serbia was involved through its military interventions in the wars in Bosnia, Croatia, Slovenia, and Kosovo. Serbian forces perpetrated numerous war crimes as part of these conflicts, including ethnic cleansing, genocide, and systematic rape. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was established in 1993 to prosecute crimes committed during the Yugoslav Wars. In 2019, Serbia was among the top 5 countries in the world with the biggest increase in their military expenditure, with a 43% increase in its military spending.",2001,39,2014,1.1B,"NAP Development
The development of Serbia’s NAP was inclusive, participatory and included input from civil society organisations (CSOs). The development of the new National Action Plan takes into account the results of the evaluations of the implementation of the previous National Action Plan (2010-2015), implemented by civil society organisations. It took into account the research studies of the academic community, civil society and international organisations concerning the implementation of UNSC Resolution 1325. In addition, public consultations on the Draft National Action Plan were organised by the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Office for Cooperation with Civil Society, the Standing Conference of Towns and Municipalities of Serbia and the OSCE Mission to Serbia in May and June 2016 in six cities.
WILPF does not have a country section in Serbia and was therefore not involved in the development of the NAP. 
The NAP drafting efforts were coordinated by the Belgrade Fund for Political Excellence, the Government of the Republic of Serbia, at the proposal of the Ministry of Defence.
NAP Implementation
The NAP highlights the role of civil society as the NAP implementing partner.  For instance, under Action 1.8 “Engaging and building the capacity of civil society organisations, academia and other actors involved in the implementation of the NAP”, the indicators are:
Number of projects and programmes for the implementation of the NAP;
The existence of a public competition for monitoring the implementation of the NAP;
Number of considered, accepted and refused civil society initiatives related to the implementation of the NAP.
The NAP assigns multiple bodies to implement the plan including the Political Council of the Government, Operational Body of the Government, and the Advisor for the implementation of the National Action Plan.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
Civil society is one of the entities responsible for the monitoring of the Plan. The NAP states that independent monitoring should continue to be performed by representatives of citizen associations (civil society organisations), academic community and the media, within their scopes of work. The NAP highlights the importance of ensuring the participation of relevant bodies dealing with gender equality at the provincial and local level.
The NAP assigns multiple bodies to monitor the implementation of the Plan, including the Commission for Monitoring the Implementation of the National Action Plan and the analytical groups and research teams.",The NAP implementation period is three years (2017-2020).,"The primary objectives of Serbia's NAP include: 
Improved efficiency and effectiveness of work of all actors, institutional bodies and mechanisms envisaged for the implementation of the National Action Plan;
Developed preventive mechanisms to increase the security of women in peace, conflict and post-conflict rehabilitation of society in the country and abroad;
Increased representation, inclusion and decision-making of women in all the processes related to the preservation of peace and security;
Improved regulatory conditions and institutional capacities for accessible and effective protection of women;
Enhanced system of support for the recovery of women who have suffered any form of threat to security in the post-conflict rehabilitation of society, crisis and emergency situations.",,"Each strategic objective has a number of listed outputs. For example, the first policy objective of Strategic Objective 1, “. Establishment and regular functioning of the Political Council for the implementation of the National Action Plan for the implementation of the UNSC Resolution 1325 – Women, Peace and Security in the Republic of Serbia in the period 2017-2020 (NAP)”, includes several indicators: -Adopted Government’s Conclusion on establishing the Political Council; -Considered reports and evaluations of the implementation of the NAP, submitted by the Operational Body; -Number and content of the meetings held by the Political Council; -Number of reports submitted to the Government along with the proposal of further activities related to the implementation of UNSC Resolution 1325 in the Republic of Serbia; -Adopted Rules of Procedure and Activity Plan; -Number of recommendations/ decisions; -Participation in relevant national and international conferences; -Number of regular reports submitted to the Government.
 ","The NAP assigns multiple bodies to monitor the implementation of the plan including the Commission for Monitoring the Implementation of the National Action Plan and the analytical groups and research teams. The NAP also lists civil society, academic community and the media as stakeholders in the monitoring process.","For each activity, the plan identifies financial resources for implementation.","The Serbian NAP mentions disarmament under the third objective in the context of equal treatment of women in decision-making and greater representation of women in the process of planning and implementation of: disarmament, peace-building, post-conflict reconstruction of society and reintegration of refugees."
Sierra Leone,"Sierra Leone adopted its second National Action Plan (NAP) for the period 2019-2023.  Its first National Action Plan (NAP) adopted in 2010 for the period 2010-2014 was developed by a collaborative process that was undertaken by a Government-Civil Society Task Force. Sierra Leone reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country stated that the implementation of the first NAP was affected by the outbreak of Ebola, and it expired in 2014 without achieving many of its strategic objectives. In November 2015, UN Women hired a consultant to undertake the final evaluation of the Sierra Leone National Action Plan on UNSCR 1325 and 1820 (2010-2014). Consultations were carried out throughout the country in collaboration with the National Steering Committee members, a structure formed for the implementation of the NAP, and offered recommendations for the second NAP. The NAP in 2019, SiLNAP II, built upon this final evaluation, as well as in-country monitoring and evaluation reports.  It aligns with the national priorities contained in The National Gender Strategic Plan, the Draft Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment Policy, and the Sierra Leone’s Medium-Term National Development Plan.  SiLNAP II focuses on six pillars of action: prevention of conflict in communities and addressing the root causes of conflicts at all levels; protection and support of women, girls and SGBV survivors and other vulnerable persons; prosecute and punish perpetrators of SGBV effectively and safeguard women’s, adolescent’s and girls’ rights at all times as well as rehabilitate perpetrators; participation and representation of women in leadership at all levels of decision-making in peacebuilding and development processes; promote peace culture and empower communities to generate and sustain their own well-being, environmental security and early response to health emergencies; promote effective coordination implementation monitoring and evaluation and reporting of the National Action Plan.  It has a comprehensive and detailed framework for monitoring and evaluation, as well as a concrete budget. Sierra Leone gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1961, after decades of colonial rule under the British empire. The country was subsequently ruled under a military dictatorship from 1967 to 1968. The most recent history of armed conflict in Sierra Leone is the civil war, which lasted from 1991 until 2002. The war had a disproportionate impact on women and girls, with thousands of women subjected to sexual violence as a weapon of war. In 2004, the Special Court for Sierra Leone ruled that the systematic violence that women were subjected to as “bush wives” during the war constituted a new crime against humanity in the form of forced marriage.  Similarly, sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) increased alarmingly in the Ebola outbreak of 2014, including an uptick of girls impregnated by a male household member or security agents enforcing quarantine.  On the 7th February 2019 Julius Maada Bio, the President of Sierra Leone, made an official declaration of a National Emergency on Rape and Sexual Violence, as a prevention and response mechanism. Despite the grave human rights violations they experienced and the fact they were at the forefront of peace, security and reconciliation efforts, women were excluded from the Lomé Peace Agreement signed in 1999, and thus were not among the negotiators, mediators, or signatories. The agreement included one provision on women’s role in post-conflict reconstruction, which stated that “special attention shall be accorded to [women’s] needs and potentials in formulating and implementing national rehabilitation, reconstruction and development programmes, to enable them to play a central role in the moral, social and physical reconstruction of Sierra Leone.”",1988,111,2014,25.6M,"NAP Development
Sierra Leone’s NAP development was initiated by The Ministry of Social Welfare, Gender and Children’s Affairs, with National Steering Committee on the implementation of UNSCRs 1325 & 1820 (NSC), in close consultation with a variety of stakeholders and actors working with WPS, such as gender focal point officers, Monitoring and Evaluation officers, Paramount Chiefs and other Community/Chiefdom level traditional authorities, UN agencies including UN Women and UNESCO, and civil society organizations.
NAP Implementation
The Ministry of Social Welfare, Gender and Children Affairs (MSWGCA) will mainly coordinate the implementation.  However, it will be inclusively implemented through the application of a localisation strategy, with the strong collaborative efforts of the Ministry of Local Government  and Rural Development, MSWGCA and local councils.  This is a ‘is a people-based approach premised on the rationale that local ownership and participation enables more effective policy action taking’ (p. 12).
NAP monitoring and evaluation
The NAP stipulates a long list of institutions that will be involved in the monitoring and evaluation process, with responsibilities such as the production of data and reporting on the implementation.  They include various governmental departments like MSWGCA, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Planning and Economic Development, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Defence; Local Government and Councils; Family Support Units (FSUs)/Special Unit on Sexual Penetration of Minors and the Sierra Leone Police 69 (SLP); The Human Rights Commission in Sierra Leone (HRCSL); National Committee on Gender-Based Violence (NAC-GBV); Traditional Authorities, Chiefdom Councils, and the Communities. 
Civil society is included through non-governmental organizations (NGOs), civil society organizations (CSOs), women’s organizations, and community-based organizations (CBOs).",The implementation period for Sierra Leone’s NAP is five years (2019-2023).,"The NAP is organized into six overarching pillars, based on the priorities identified in consultations:
Prevention of conflict in communities and addressing the root causes of conflicts at all levels;
Protection and support of women, girls and SGBV survivors and other vulnerable persons;
Prosecute and punish perpetrators of SGBV effectively and safeguard women’s, adolescent’s and girls’ rights at all times as well as rehabilitate perpetrators;
Participation and representation of women in leadership at all levels of decision-making in peacebuilding and development processes;
Promote peace culture and empower communities to generate and sustain their own well-being, environmental security and early response to health emergencies;
Promote effective coordination, implementation, monitoring and evaluation, and reporting of the National Action Plan.","The NAP is comprehensive in its approach to the specified overarching goals.  It breaks each of the six pillars into output objectives, each with a set of strategies and specific activities.
For example, under Pillar 1 of ‘Prevention of conflict in communities and addressing the root causes of conflicts at all levels’, the first output objective is ‘Communities’ stakeholders’ commitment to promoting peaceful coexistence by addressing the root causes of conflict at community level increased/strengthened’ (p. 22), with two strategies:  
Ensuring the establishment and approval and implementation of bylaws that seek to prevent VAW/GBV and protect women, girls and adolescent youth, and vulnerable persons
Parliamentary Finance Oversight Committee examination and assessing existing national budget allocation to GE and specifically to SiLNAP implementation
Specific activity for these strategies: ‘Harmonise/ align the relevant provisions of and remove inconsistency between the Child Rights Act and the Registration of Customary Marriage and Divorce Act with respect to age of marriage’ (p. 22).
 ","Each output objective within the six pillars is given a set of indicators (with an emphasis on quantitative indicators throughout the NAP), as well as primary stakeholders, other partners and timeline for completion.
For example, under Pillar 4 of ‘Participation and representation of women in leadership at all levels of decision-making in peacebuilding and development processes’, the output objective ‘Representation of women in Security committees at provincial, district and chiefdom levels and other governance committees at especially chiefdom levels’ (p. 33) is given 3 indicators: 
Number of meetings held with officials in the security sector 
Percentage of women made aware of their roles and responsibilities in peacebuilding 
100 women trained in peacebuilding and human rights in districts and chiefdoms
The list of stakeholders for this goal is naturally long, given the aim of participation throughout all levels, and includes ONS, Regional, District, and local council officials, Chiefdom Council officials, community women, traditional authorities, the parliamentary Female Caucus, the Legislative committee, ‘Male Champions’, and women’s organizations.  Other partners identified are bilateral and multilateral organizations, as well as the United Nations Development Programme.  The timeline indicated for this particular output objective is 2019-2022.","The NAP includes a robust framework for implementation.  There are four objectives for the framework (p. 54)
Determining the institutional readiness at all levels (national and local level) for the monitoring and evaluation of the National Action Plan (NAP) for the implementation of UNSCRs 1325 and 1820. 
Defining an institutional framework with clear roles and responsibilities for all relevant actors. 
Identifying monitorable indicators and developing a results framework that will guide the tracking of progress in the implementation of the NAP. 
Setting up data collection guidelines for measuring progress in the implementation of the NAP.
The framework is based on the same objective outputs, and summarized strategies with an output, indicator, MoV, baseline data, four milestones and a target per strategy.
For instance, Pillar 3 of ‘Prosecute and punish perpetrators of SGBV effectively and safeguard women’s, adolescent’s and girls’ rights at all times as well as rehabilitate perpetrators’ includes the objective output of ‘Institutions and other justice sector mechanisms committed to protect women, adolescents and girls from, and respond to VAW and sexual violence offences’.  For the strategy ‘Enhance the effectiveness of gender justice institutions’ (p.56): 
Output: Capacitated gender justice institutions
Indicator: Number of gender related issues speedily investigated, prosecuted and verdict passed 
MoV: FSU, Courts and related NGOs, e.g., Rainbow Centre records 
Baseline data: To be determined 
Milestones: Gaps in gender justice sector institutions identified; Capacitated gender justice sector institutions; Period for investigation, prosecution and verdict passed on gender related issues reduced by 20%; Period for investigating, prosecuting and passing verdict on gender issues reduced by 20%
Target: Period for gender related trials reduced by 40%","Each specific action within the six pillars is given a budget estimate in USD($) for each year of implementation, as well as a total budget for all years.
For example, under Pillar 2, the fourth output objective of reducing teenage pregnancy in local communities, is broken down into five specific activities including: 
Action 1 of ‘Hold dialogue sessions with key communities’ stakeholders, including traditional leaders, male champions, parents, especially fathers and teenagers’ (p. 38) is allocated $50,000 USD per year for 2019 and 2020, and $40 000 USD per year for 2021, 2022 and 2023.  The total budget for Action 1 is $220,000 USD.
Action 3 of ‘Provide livelihood skills training in agriculture, and other sectors’ (p. 39) is allocated $80 000 USD per year for 2019, 2020 and 2021, and $60 000 USD per year for 2022 and 2023.  The total budget is $360,000 USD.
In addition, the NAP includes a section on resource mobilization.  A list of potential sources of donations across multilateral and bilateral organizations, the private sector, NGOs/CSOs/CBOs, and other sources can be found on p. 46.  A budget for the implementation of the Monitoring and Evaluation Plan is also included (p. 68).  It is broken down into three sections of capacity building ($115,000 USD over 5 years), running institutional framework ($135,000 USD over 5 years) and support to routine data systems ($150,000 USD over 5 years).","The NAP does not include provisions for disarmament nor does it address small arms or weapons.  Despite a focus on SGBV in two of the six pillars and the country’s post-conflict context, the NAP does not address small arms and light weapons (SALW), control measures of SALW, nor the gendered impacts of their illegal circulation, particularly in increasing the risk of SGBV."
Slovakia,"Slovakia adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2020 for the period 2021-2025. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs in cooperation with the Ministries of Labour, Social Affairs and Family; Defence of the Slovak Republic, and the Interior along with the Presidium of the Police Force. The NAP does not identify civil society actors in its development process. The NAP has four strategic goals: increasing women’s participation in peace and security; taking into account and protecting women’s human rights and their specific needs in line with the Women, Peace and Security agenda; raising awareness and deepening expertise on the Women, Peace and Security agenda; and international cooperation. Each of these strategic goals have operational objectives, a method of evaluation, timeline and the respective ministry that will carry out the activity. The NAP lacks clarity on the implementation structure and monitoring and evaluation framework. It also does not allocate a specific budget, nor does it state the cost of activities expected to be carried out by the various ministries. Slovakia became an independent state in 1993 following the peaceful dissolution of Czechoslovakia. The country does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but contributes to overseas military operations and peacekeeping missions. In 2019, Slovakia was among the top 5 countries in the world with the biggest increase in their military expenditure, with a 48% increase in its military spending. Most recently, in 2019, the Slovak Parliament passed a resolution to stop the ratification process of the Istanbul Convention, a Council of Europe treaty to prevent domestic violence and violence against women, as well as calling on the government to block the European Union’s accession to the Convention. At the multilateral level, Slovakia most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2006-2007.",1993,63,2014,1.8B,"NAP Development
The NAP does not mention the role of civil society actors in its development process. 
The Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs of the Slovak Republic led the NAP development process in cooperation with the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the Slovak Republic, the Ministry of Defence of the Slovak Republic, and the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic/Presidium of the Police Force.
NAP Implementation 
Civil society does not have a direct role in implementation of Slovakia’s NAP. However, as the NAP will be carried out through the activities of the various ministries, their respective list of activities states: Strengthen cooperation with civil society, local women's and gender equality organizations in order to promote and educate on equal opportunities as a development cooperation agenda in partner countries; Support for the activities of non-governmental organizations active in the field of the WPS agenda. 
The main and direct implementers of the Slovakia’s NAP are: the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family of the Slovak Republic, the Ministry of Defence of the Slovak Republic, the Ministry of Interior of the Slovak Republic/Presidium of the Police Force, and the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs of the Slovak Republic. Each of these ministries will carry out various activities to implement the NAP. 
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
Civil society is not involved in the monitoring and evaluation of the NAP.
The ministries involved in the implementation of the NAP will submit a summary evaluation report in 2026 as part of the National Action Plan for 2026–2030 to the Committee for Gender Equality which is a permanent expert body for human rights, national minorities and gender equality and monitors the implementation of CEDAW and other international human rights conventions.",The NAP is developed for the period of 2021 to 2025.,"The NAP has four strategic goals based on the four pillars of the WPS agenda:  Increasing women's participation in peace and security; Taking into account and protecting women's human rights and their specific needs in line with the Women, Peace and Security agenda; Raising awareness and deepening expertise on the Women, Peace and Security agenda; International cooperation. 
Each of these goals have certain operational objectives. For example, to further Goal 1, following are the objectives (pg 17): 
Adoption of measures to increase the representation of women in the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic and the Police Force, including decision making positions
Taking measures to increase the representation of women in military and civilian missions, as well as in international organizations, including decision-making positions.
Implementing measures to promote the reconciliation of work and private life
Ensuring equal pay for men and women in the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic, in the Police Force, in military and civilian missions and in the field of humanitarian aid","The activities required to be taken by each implementing ministry is outlined in the NAP. For instance, the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family will undertake the following activities/commitments:  
Incorporating the WPS agenda into the activities and topics of the Committee for Gender Equality of the Council of the Government of the Slovak Republic for Human Rights, National Minorities and Gender Equality; 
The ILFR cooperation on educational events on the topic of WPS; 
Support for the activities of non-governmental organizations active in the field of the WPS agenda.","Each of the strategic goals mentioned in the NAP have an operation objective and respective methods of evaluation. For instance, in Goal 2: 
The operational objective:  Taking measures concerning the specific needs and protection of the rights of women and girls at all stages and areas of conflict resolution 
Has the following methods of evaluation: 
number of measures that take into account the needs of women and girls, including the protection of political rights, economic rights, and protection against violence and sexual violence 
monitoring the effectiveness of implemented measures
However, these methods/indicators are rather vague and do not outline the specific measures required to be taken. ","The NAP lacks clarity on a specific monitoring and evaluation framework. Although it states that the ministries will submit an evaluation report to the Gender Equality Committee. 
“Once a year, the Gender Equality Committee discusses the current implementation of the objectives of the National Action Plan. On this basis, it will continuously recommend updating the National Action Plan in line with developments in the WPS agenda at the UN, with the international obligations of the Slovak Republic and the obligations arising from EU membership” (pg 7).",The NAP does not allocate specific funds to carry out the various activities by the ministries nor does it state how these funds will be procured.,"The NAP does not reference disarmament, small arms and DDR nor does it draw the direct link between gender and disarmament as a crucial aspect of the WPS implementation. "
Slovenia,"Slovenia adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2018 for the period 2018-2020. The NAP was developed by the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, based on the findings of the implementation review of the first NAP. The NAP is grounded in various national and international frameworks that pertain to gender mainstreaming in peace and security. The NAP approaches the implementation of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda both domestically and internationally, while indicating that Slovenia’s capacity to integrate a gender perspective to peace and security in the international arena will bolster the country’s implementation of the WPS Agenda at the national level. The NAP also stresses the importance of a domestic focus to the action plan in order to address emergent issues of the increasing number of migrants and violent extremism. The NAP identifies five overarching goals: integration of gender in peace and security policy; women’s increased involvement in the peace and security sector arena; protection of women and girls from and prevention of sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV); education and training pertaining to WPS; and prosecution of perpetrators of SGBV. While the NAP has a monitoring and implementation framework, it does not include an allocated budget. Slovenia’s second NAP is preceded by one other NAP, adopted in 2010 and implemented for the period 2010-2015. The NAP identifies gender mainstreaming in conflict prevention and resolution, including through strengthening women’s role in preventing conflict and post-conflict reconstruction; increasing the number of women in peacekeeping missions; and protection of women and girls from and prevention of sexual and gender-based violence in conflict and post-conflict settings. While similar in areas of focus, the second NAP expands these objectives. Whereas the first NAP does not focus on disarmament, for instance, the second NAP mentions promoting gender mainstreaming in disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) efforts. Additionally, the second NAP provides an overview of accomplishments in implementing the first NAP, both domestically and internationally, including through quantifiable measures. Nevertheless, the NAP does not specifically identify lessons learned in terms of challenges encountered during the first NAP’s implementation. Furthermore, while financing WPS actions is addressed within the second NAP, neither action plan has an allocated budget. Slovenia gained independence from Yugoslavia in 1991 after a brief conflict (also referred to as the “Ten-Day War”) between Yugoslav and Slovenian forces. The country has not had a history of conflict since then. Slovenia is a contributor to overseas military missions and peacekeeping operations. Additionally, a previous member of NATO’s Partnership for Peace Program , Slovenia became a full member of NATO in 2004. At the national level, in 2015, Slovenia’s Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities adopted a set of Guidelines for Gender Mainstreaming in the Work of Ministries. In 2016, Slovenia established the Advocate of the Principle of Equality, which is an independent body charged with gender equality.",1992,36,2014,569M,"NAP Development
The NAP indicates that “civil society and other stakeholders” were consulted about the draft text of the action plan. However, the NAP does not provide further details on how or which civil society organizations were consulted. 
WILPF does not have a country section in Slovenia and was therefore not involved in the development of the NAP. 
The NAP was developed by Slovenia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in cooperation with the Ministry of Defense; Ministry of the Interior; Ministry of Health; Ministry of Justice; and Ministry of Labor, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities. 
NAP Implementation
The NAP does not indicate civil society involvement in the implementation of the action plan. 
Several ministries, such as the Ministry of Defense and Ministry of the Interior, among others, are tasked with implementing various objectives of the NAP.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
The NAP indicates that non-governmental organizations and civil society will be invited to the inter-ministerial meetings at the working level to participate in the evaluation of the action plan. However, the NAP does not provide further details on how or which non-governmental and civil society organizations will be included in the monitoring and evaluation process.
The NAP indicates that Slovenia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs will be responsible for coordinating the preparation of evaluation reports. ",The implementation period of the NAP is two years (2018-2020).,"Slovenia’s NAP identifies five overarching areas of focus for the implementation of the action plan:
Implementation of the Women, Peace and Security Agenda and the integration of gender in the peace and security policy;
Women involved in peace and security area;
Women and girls protection before the conflict, between and after the conflict, and elimination of sexual violence and gender based violence related to conflicts;
Education and training in the field of Women, Peace and Security Agenda;
Responsibility for the prevention and prosecution of perpetrators of sexual violence and gender based violence related to conflicts.","Slovenia’s NAP identifies five overarching areas of focus, with each area having its corresponding activity. For example, focus #5, “Responsibility for the prevention and prosecution of perpetrators of sexual violence and gender based violence related to conflicts,” lists “Commitment to prosecute those responsible for sexual violence and gender based violence, and to eliminate the culture of impunity within international forums, even when dealing with individual situations or countries” as an activity.","Slovenia’s NAP identifies five overarching areas of focus, with each area having corresponding activities, operators, and indicators. For example, activity #1 under the objective to end impunity for sexual and gender-based violence lists “appearances and statements of male and female representatives of the Republic of Slovenia, which include the importance of prosecution of those responsible for gender based crimes and the elimination of the culture of impunity in discussions in the UN (NATO, SSR and other UN bodies), NATO, the EU and the OSCE at various levels or at international events related to this area” as an indicator.","Slovenia’s NAP will be evaluated through a two-step process: 1) A reporting system and 2) Meetings of relevant governmental and non-governmental stakeholders. Two annual reports will be prepared in 2018 and 2019 to monitor the implementation of the NAP. Additionally, a final report, with an overview of the implementation and recommendations for the future, will be prepared after the NAP’s expiration period. Furthermore, implementation will also be evaluated through biannual inter-ministerial meetings. The NAP indicates that additional meetings will be convened, if needed.","The NAP does not contain an allocated or estimated budget. However, the NAP does mention financial support for the implementation of the WPS Agenda at the international level. Specifically, the NAP mentions “financial support to the various mechanisms of international organizations that support Implementation of Women, Peace and Security Agenda” and “earmarking relevant contributions that are not directly related to the topic of women, peace and security, in the implementation of the Women, Peace and Security Agenda (example: the financial contribution of the Republic of Slovenia in support of the Afghan security forces was used specifically for the needs of the female members of the Afghan Security Forces).”","The NAP mentions disarmament once under the goal of “promoting gender mainstreaming in areas related to peace and security” within the context of Slovenia’s participation in discussions on international organizations and events, including disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration. Otherwise, the NAP does not have a substantive engagement with or plan of action to address issues of disarmament and demilitarization."
Solomon Islands,"Solomon Islands adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2017 for the period 2017-2021. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Women, Youth, Children and Family Affairs, and supported by the Ministry of National Unity, Reconciliation and Peace, the Ministry of Police, Corrections and National Security, and the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force with technical and financial support by the Government of Australia, UN Women, and UNDP for the during the NAP development process. The NAP acknowledges the importance of civil society involvement in the implementation of the WPS agenda, but does not specify details on civil society involvement in the country’s NAP. The NAP aims to support the recommendations made by the previous Truth and Reconciliation Commission, specifically as it pertains to women and girls, CEDAW General Recommendation 30, and the entire WPS agenda, including access to government services, protection, prevention and rehabilitation with the promise that a commitment to women’s rights will be reflected in “all related policies, programs and budgets, including the resources [the Solomon Islands] invest in recovery and reparation.” The NAP does not include an allocated budget, but indicates that a financing and implementation plan will be developed in the first six months of the NAP timeline. Solomon Islands gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1978. The most recent history of armed conflict in Solomon Islands was a period of civil unrest known locally as “ The Tensions ,” which lasted from 1998 until 2003, when the Townsville Peace Agreement was signed. The conflict had a disproportionate impact on women and girls, who were deliberately targeted with violence, the reverberations of which continue to this date, including through the societal impacts of post-conflict trauma. During the Tensions, women played a key role in peacemaking using traditional practices and churches to mediate and place pressure on parties to disarm, as well as a role providing social, spiritual and material support to one another and to combatants. Despite these efforts, women were excluded from the peace agreement negotiations and amnesty was given to all actors, depriving women and girls and other affected people access to justice and accountability. Currently, the Solomon Islands is affected by environmental challenges such as increasing climate temperatures, rising sea levels, commercial logging, food (in)security for increasing populations with decreasing agricultural viability, and the destabilization of communities.",2002,,,,"NAP Development
The National Action Plan states that collaboration with civil society is needed to implement women, peacebuilding, and participation. Women civil society actors are not particularly acknowledged as having played a substantive role in shaping the plan. However, the document mentions that it reflects the “current context and priorities in Solomon Islands and has been shaped and endorsed by government ministries, provincial stakeholders, civil society, women's groups and churches at all levels”.
The NAP was launched by the Ministry of Women, Youth, Children & Family Affairs (MWYFCA) of the Solomon Islands through a consultative and collaborative process led by the Ministry of Women, Youth, Children and Family Affairs, and the support of the Ministry of National Unity, Reconciliation and Peace, the Ministry of Police, Corrections and National Security, and the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force. The Government of Australia, UN Women, and UNDP provided technical and financial support during the NAP development process.
NAP Implementation
Overall implementation of the National Action Plan is to be overseen by the Ministry of Women, Youth, Children and Family Affairs through its Women's Development Division (WDD). A Resource and Implementation Plan with a list of financial resources and operational support needed for implementation by relevant ministries and partners was planned to be developed in the first six months of the NAP's timeframe. The role of civil society in supporting or monitoring implementation is vague.
The role of women in peace and security is one of the seven priority outcomes of the National Gender Equality and Women Development Policy 2016-2020 (NGEWD), and the coordination of the implementation of the NAP will be led by the MWYFCA, the government Ministry responsible for advancing gender equality and promoting women's empowerment. The NAP will be implemented through national and provincial institutions and processes, in close cooperation with communities, civil society organisations, and development partners. MWYCFA will play the key leadership and coordination role in the implementation of action items across government, and lead on implementation of action items assigned to them in the Action and Results Matrix.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation 
A national WPS Steering and Monitoring Group was slated to be established to oversee progress on the implementation of the National Action Plan on WPS. This group is meant to review data on strategies and actions, and provide recommendations to inform implementation, track results, and contribute to reporting on progress. Reporting is to follow requirements from CEDAW, the National Gender Equality and Women's Development (GEWD) Policy 2016-2020, which, as one of its seven outcomes, specifies recognition of the role of women in maintaining peace and national security; and the National Peacebuilding Policy. The NAP also notes that periodic reporting on CEDAW will contribute to impact assessment of efforts toward achieving substantive equality. It is not clear from the NAP what specific role  civil society has in M&E efforts. The NAP does mention that as multi stakeholder, multisectorial initiative, the NAP requires the collective effort of diverse partners, including government, civil society, communities, the UN system and development partners. The NAP will be implemented through national and provincial institutions and processes, in close cooperation with communities, civil society organisations, and development partners.",The NAP is to cover four years of implementation from 2017-2021.,"The Solomon Islands’ NAP is broken down into four pillars: Participation, Protection, Prevention, and Recovery and Reconciliation. Designed to cover the WPS agenda pillars, this section delineates the required actions and expected results.
Participation: Women's participation, representation and decision-making in peace and security are expanded at all levels:
1.1. Expanding formal mechanisms for women's participation and the reflection of women's priorities in peace and security institutions, policy agendas, budgets, and progress monitoring, including rural, remote, urban, disabled, and young women and girls.  
1.2. Increasing women's representation in national peace and security decision-making and establish quotas to address the multiple barriers to women's participation.   
1.3 Strengthen capacities and increase resources to ensure gender equality and women's empowerment are central to security institutions and mechanisms, peacebuilding and conflict prevention activities, at all levels.
Protection: Women’s human rights are protected, and women are secured from sexual and gender based violence:
2.1. Strengthen the protection of women and girls by building the capacity of government and civil society actors, including traditional leaders and those responding to humanitarian crises
2.2 Ensure Solomon Islands ongoing transitional justice processes respect women's rights, address gender-based violations, and are inclusive of rural and remote women.   
2.3 Combat impunity for gender based violence and ensure protection of women's human rights, including through prosecuting perpetrators.
Prevention: Solomon Islands actively prevents conflict and violence against women and girls:
3.1 Implement reforms in security institutions that prioritise VAW prevention, respond to women's diverse security concerns, and respect women's rights.
3.2 Challenge discriminatory gender norms, attitudes and behaviour, including through working with men and boys.
3.3 Decrease the risk of sexual and gender-based violence and conflict during periods of natural disaster, humanitarian crisis and instability.
Recovery and Reconciliation: Women and girls priorities and rights are reflected in all development and peace building:
4.1 Strengthen women's agency and capacities in recovery and reconciliation processes.
4.2 Promote equitable peace and recovery processes","Each objective of the NAP outlines actions for achieving the overall elements of the plan. Each are elaborated on in the Action and Results Matrix (ARM). For example, under the protection pillar, the ARM contains the following actions:
Sensitise traditional and religious leaders on gender equality and women's rights principles, relevant national laws and international instruments, including CEDAW and UNSCR 1325 to ensure the traditional justice system consistently delivers equal protection for the rights of women and girls.
Provide technical guidance and capacity building on gender and security issues to all uniformed officers, including Immigration and. border enforcement/ protection staff
Include women from border communities in policy consultations and border agreement talks, to ensure identification of women's protection and conflict prevention priorities, including issues related to economic security and cross-border trade, trafficking, arms and GBV.   
Build women and men’s capacities to facilitate community dialogue, including disseminating findings and recommendations from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Report to affected communities.
Work with women victims/ survivors to develop strategies to redress conflict related rights violations, with a specific focus on SGBV, that take into account inter- national principles and standards of administration of justice and reparations.
Ensure justice mechanisms that consider conflict-related cases, including special courts, are accessible to women survivors in rural and remote areas, and that these prioritise women's human rights violations.",The NAP does not identify indicators which measure the actions that will lead to the expected results outlined in the plan.,"Intention for creating a M&E plan is mentioned in the NAP, but there is no breakdown of what this consists of or the timeline for such a process.","There is no projected budget provided in the NAP. The NAP states that a Resource and Implementation Plan outlining the financial resources and operational support needed for implementation by relevant ministries and partners, and sequencing and prioritisation of all Actions, will be developed in the first six months of the NAP's timeframe. The NAP will be implemented over four years (2017-2021).","The NAP mentions disarmament as one of the central concerns during the earlier peace process but does not provide a coherent plan on how disarmament, demobilisation, and reintegration efforts will be conducted under this plan. It mentions that women and their rights were excluded from the earlier peace process, which did not provide for women’s protection and recovery, and gave amnesty and security sector jobs to perpetrators and ex-combatants. Issues surrounding disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration are mentioned in the NAP through discussion of CEDAW General Recommendation 30, the Townsville Peace Agreement, and other policies."
South Africa,,1995,17,2014,3.15B,"South Africa began the process of developing its NAP in 2009. For transparency and context, the NAP provides details on how the process stalled and then was revived in 2011, 2015, and in 2018 to finalize it. On page 59 there is a timeline that shows the many steps taken towards the NAP from 2009 to the present day.
The three departments that led the process of the NAP are the Department of Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities, the Department of Defence and Military Veterans and the Department of International Relations and Cooperation. There is a National Steering Committee, formed by government and CSO representatives, that facilitated the consultations in the development process. There is a proposed governance model (pg 84), and the NAP also contains an acknowledgements section that acknowledges the different stakeholders who contributed. There were provincial consultations and a national consultative workshop, and a Drafting Team was formed. There were further consultations on the zero draft in 2019.
Civil society in South Africa long advocated for a NAP and also was instrumental in the process of reviving the 2020-2025 NAP’s development. They formed a steering group to collate the inputs of different stakeholders to the process, and engaged in the multi-stakeholder consultative meeting. On page 43, there is a list of points that emerged from civil society dialogues on WPS, which were incorporated into the NAP. 
The NAP states that implementation will be coordinated by the three ministries above,as well as other important departments identified that include police, corrections, DPME, and the presidential policy unit. Civil society and other representatives will also serve on this committee, as will the National Focal Point on WPS. 
Each year, a National Policy Forum with representatives from government, civil society, academia, private sector and development partners will meet and evaluate progress towards the NAP’s stated objectives.",The implementation period for the South African National Action Plan is 2020-2025.,"The main principle underpinning the NAP is the link between state security and human security, as well as the idea that peace and security for women “must be accompanied by larger transformative processes, behavioural change, and peace and security for the society at large”. It is anchored on the four main WPS pillars of protection, participation, prevention, and relief and recovery. Key terms are identified in the NAP to provide a basis for common understanding of terminology. 
There are several main objectives:
To promote, protect and respect an inclusive, safe and peaceful society by operationalising the WPS Agenda in South Africa;
To implement, evaluate and report on agreed upon WPS frameworks at international, continental and regional levels;
To ensure the full and meaningful participation of women in peace and security processes, structures and institutions at all levels;
To establish and implement effective conflict management institutions, systems and processes;
To prevent violence against women, girls and gender non-conforming persons and protect them in all situations;
To position and promote South Africa as a credible international leader on issues related to WPS;
To ensure an integrated and coordinated approach to, and the utilisation of best practices towards information and knowledge management for WPS.","Within the four WPS pillars, the National Action Plan lists seven priority areas and 21 specific strategic objectives. 
Under Pillar 1 on Participation, there are two priorities: To develop, implement and assess gender-sensitive laws, policies and strategies; and to Ensure meaningful participation of women in peace processes, structures and institutions. Under Pillar 1 Priority 1, there are two objectives: Ensure effective participation of civil society; and Enhance accountability for the implementation of the WPS NAP.
The priorities under the other pillars are as follows:
Prevention: Create an inclusive, peaceful and safe society; Prevention measures for safer societies; Empowering women and comprehending their needs.
Protection: Enhance the protection of women, girls and gender non-conforming persons from all forms of abuse, violence and discrimination.
Relief and Recovery: The provision of safe spaces of refuge for victims of humanitarian crises.
Under each of these priorities, there are multiple activities, expected outcomes, indicators and means of verification, time frame, and key actors. Some examples of activities include: 
Review the foreign policy and ensure it is gender-sensitive
Establish a National Policy Forum on WPS from the three spheres of government, civil society and the private sector that feeds into the security cluster
Strengthen the relevant parliamentary oversight committees to ensure the implementation of WPS
Provide family support and family planning educational campaigns and programmes
Provide trauma-informed counselling at family clinics
Develop awareness programmes and concrete measures to address the violent expressions of Homophobia
Develop awareness programmes and concrete measures to prevent xenophobia","Under each of the activities there are indicators listed. For example, under Strategic Objective 1.2.2 Women's representation and participation in national peace and security structures, there is an indicator “Peace tables held on a biennial basis.” Each indicator corresponds to a timeframe, relevant actors, and expected outcomes. 
The full matrix of priorities, activities, and indicators can be found starting on page 64.","The DPME will support the development of a full monitoring and evaluation plan, which will facilitate the tracking of progress towards implementation. The NAP states that all stakeholders will be expected to report on their work towards NAP implementation. To better support this, the NAP aligns with priorities that were outlined in the 2019 State of the Nation Address, and indicators align with the AU continental results framework. Gender activities will be viewed not as new work but are meant to be mainstreamed in existing systems and initiatives.","The NAP contains a budget, and there will be comprehensive costing in alignment with the Gender-Responsive Planning, Budgeting, Monitoring, Evaluation, and Auditing framework. The total estimated budget for the NAP will be 560,000,000 ZAR. The NAP acknowledges that the South African economy is not doing well so funding is difficult, but states that South Africa will be proactively looking to channel resources.","There is one activity on disarmament in the NAP, “Ensure more women are trained in gender and disarmament and participate in international forums on the topic”. This is under Strategic Objective 1.2.1, Women's representation and participation at international and continental peace and security structures and processes."
South Sudan,"South Sudan adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2015 for the period 2015-2020. The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Gender, Child and Social Welfare (MGCSW) through a participatory process that included broad consultations with various peace and security stakeholders and supported by UN Women. Additionally, the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) acted as the co-chair of the development process, collecting and harmonizing views from government institutions, development partners, United Nations agencies, civil society organisations, women’s groups and religious and traditional leaders. The overall goal of the NAP is to strengthen the participation of women in peace and security efforts and facilitate the creation of an enabling environment for their leadership and political participation in conflict resolution and allow for more inclusive, just and sustainable peace, recovery and reconstruction processes, where a gender perspective is integrated into the design and implementation of all policies related to peace and security. The NAP has an implementation matrix that breaks down objectives to corresponding actions, outcomes, indicators, key actors, and a time frame. Nevertheless, the NAP does not have an allocated budget, instead tasking implementing actors to develop a financing plan. South Sudan reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country reported that the Gender Machinery in South Sudan is monitoring the implementation of the NAP as well as the Standing Operating Procedures (SOPs) on gender-based violence (GBV) among other human rights violations. South Sudan additionally reported on women’s participation in peace in the country. In the build-up to the renewed peace efforts, 43 South Sudanese women organizations and other NGOs working on women empowerment and peace signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on October 21, 2018 to collaborate and work together. In the renewed 2018 peace effort, one of the mediators was a woman and female leaders of civil society groups served as official observers. Women made up 25 percent of official delegates, and members of the Women’s Coalition (p. 82). South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011. The most recent armed conflict in the country’s history was the civil war , which lasted from 2013 until 2018 and resulted in thousands of casualties and displaced people. The war had a disproportionate impact on women, with sexual violence used as a weapon of war. Women made concerted efforts to be included in the peace process and had relative success in their efforts. Women comprised 15% of delegates leading the negotiations for the 2015 peace agreement while women comprised 25% of delegates during the 2018 negotiations. While all signatories representing conflict parties in the 2018 peace agreement were men, women constituted seven out of 17 (41%) of civil society signatories.",,,,86.5M,"NAP Development
Civil society organisations and women’s groups and religious participated in the participatory process of developing the NAP in South Sudan, including through consultation with the various peace and security stakeholders and supported by UN WOMEN. The process, led by the Ministry of Gender, Child and Social Welfare (MGCSW), with the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS). Civil society organisations were also included in the National Steering Committee that led the development of the NAP. At the same time, no specific civil society organisations were mentioned in the NAP.                           
WILPF does not have a country section in South Sudan and was therefore not involved in the development of the NAP.  
The NAP has been developed through a rigorous participatory process involving broad consultation of various peace and security stakeholders and supported by UN WOMEN. The process, led by the Ministry of Gender, Child and Social Welfare (MGCSW), with the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) as the co-chair, has collected and harmonised views from government institutions, development partners, United Nations agencies, civil society organisations, women’s groups and religious and traditional leaders.      
NAP Implementation
The National Steering Committee, that includes civil society organisations,  coordinate and monitors the South Sudanese NAP implementation. Civil society organisations also listed as the key actors for implementations of strategic objectives of the NAP under each category.
To facilitate the identification of priority areas of immediate action for improving the lives of women and children in South Sudan and ensuring increased investment for strengthened implementation of UNSCR 1325, a National Steering Committee comprised of government ministries, commissions, United Nations agencies and civil society organisations was formed. The National Steering Committee, which will continue to coordinate and monitor the South Sudan National Action Plan implementation, is chaired by the the Ministry of Gender, Child and Social Welfare (MGCSW).
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
Civil society does not have a specific role in monitoring and evaluation of the NAP implementation.
Implementation of the National Action Plan for UNSCR 1325 will be monitored by an inter-ministerial committee comprised of ve Government ministries, namely, the MGCSW, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation and Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning. The Inter-Ministerial Committee will be chaired by the MGCSW, with the Ministry of Defence and Ministry of Justice as co-chairs, and will meet twice a year (every six months) to evaluate the progress of National Action Plan implementation and receive the mid-year reports from the National Steering Committee. The Inter-Ministerial Committee will also receive and approve the National Annual Report on UNSCR 1325 and submit it to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who will then present it to the Council of Ministers to have it tabled for debate in Parliament.",The implementation period for the Sudanese National Plan of Action is five years (2015-2020).,"The National Action Plan is based on the mandate of UNSCR 1325 and the activities to be implemented fall under the four pillars of the resolution, as follows:
Prevention: Reduction in con ict and all forms of structural and physical violence against women, particularly sexual and gender-based violence;
Participation: Inclusion of women and women’s interests in decision-making processes related to the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts;
Protection: Women’s safety, physical and mental health and economic security are assured and their human rights respected; and   
Relief and recovery: Women’s specific needs are met in conflict and post-conflict situations.","Each pillar has different actions assigned. For example, Strategic Goal 1 (Increase women’s effective participation in leadership and peacebuilding and strengthen gender perspectives in the South Sudan’s state-building and reconstruction processes)  includes the following actions:   
Examine and review all laws, policies and programmes within South Sudan’s socio-economic and political context in order to promote and guarantee equal opportunities and active and meaningful participation of women in politics and in positions of power and decision-making positions, taking into consideration the special needs and interests of women with disabilities;           
Promote equal access and opportunities for women and girls, including those with disabilities, to education, vocational and technical training, in-service training and skills development by deliberately addressing the roots of their poverty to enable them to engage in meaningful employment, attain economic empowerment and effectively participate in the country’s rebuilding and democratic processes;
Improve women’s economic status by ensuring that reconstruction programmes undertaken in South Sudan equitably benefit women and girls, including those with disabilities; women are invited to participate and contribute to government and donor discussions and decisions taken on recovery and reconstruction projects to be financed and implemented;
Actively involve women in the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) programme and ensure that all those involved in planning for DDR consider the different needs of female and male ex-combatants and the WAAF/G, and take into account the needs of their dependents.","Each strategic goal has a number of listed indicators. For example, the first goal, “Review all laws (statutory and customary) that undermine or hinder women’s participation in decision-making and governance in their bid to actively engage in South Sudan’s recovery, development and democratic processes ”, includes several indicators:
Number of laws reviewed;
Number of sensitization campaigns held to consult with and inform traditional leaders and communities on negative cultural practices that hinder women’s leadership potential;
Number of women actively involved in governance and recovery processes.","The Inter-Ministerial Committee meets twice a year (every six months) to evaluate the progress of National Action Plan implementation and receive the mid-year reports from the National Steering Committee. The Inter-Ministerial Committee also receives and approves the National Annual Report on UNSCR 1325 and submits it to the Minister of Foreign A airs, who will then present it to the Council of Ministers to have it tabled for debate in Parliament. Every two years the Government compiles a report on UNSCR 1325 and submitS it to the United Nations Secretary General as required under the resolution. A mid-term evaluation of implementation will be conducted in 2016 after the compilation of the report to the United Nations Secretary General and a final review will be prepared in the fourth year (2018) to pave the way for the development of a revised National Action Plan.","Based on the National Action Plan, government institutions and implementing partners will develop detailed activity plans related to their areas of operation and budget for these activities, as well as take full financial responsibility for their implementation.
The proposed National Action Plan activities are not restrictive and the exibility provided for allows room for stakeholders to adjust their programming so as to rapidly respond to changing environments and conflict-related developments in the country. This flexibility also permits the different actors to utilise new windows of opportunity in funding that may emerge in the course of this action plan’s years. ","Strategic Objective 4 under the Strategic Goal 1 (Increase women’s effective participation in leadership and peacebuilding and strengthen gender perspectives in the South Sudan’s state-building and reconstruction processes) assigns all relevant actors to actively involve women in the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) programme and ensure that all those involved in planning for DDR consider the different needs of female and male ex-combatants and take into account the needs of their dependents."
Spain,"Spain adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2017 for the period 2017-2023. The NAP was developed by an Interministerial Working Group with the overarching goal to “contribute to ensuring the protection of the human rights of women and girls, and their substantive participation in conflict prevention, as well as achieving and consolidating peace” (p. 16). The NAP highlights that UNSCR 2242 (2015) was approved during Spain’s presidency of the Security Council, underscoring the importance of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) Agenda for Spain. The NAP stresses the importance of the agentive status of women, emphasizing the importance of gender equality for the full implementation of WPS commitments. The NAP takes both a national and international approach to the implementation of the WPS Agenda, with particular focus on tackling the commitments holistically and promoting the interlinkages between gender equality reforms during implementation. Additionally, the NAP promotes an integrated agenda by demonstrating the links of the WPS Agenda to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with particular emphasis on SDGs 5 and 16 on gender equality and peace and justice, respectively. Nevertheless, the NAP does not include a substantive monitoring and evaluation framework or an allocated budget. Spain’s most recent NAP is preceded by one other NAP, adopted in 2007, without a specific period of implementation. The first NAP had six overarching goals. While two of these goals focused on peacekeeping missions, the remaining goals focused on strengthening gender-sensitive peacebuilding; protecting the human rights of women and girls in conflict and post-conflict states; increasing women in disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) efforts; and encouraging the participation of Spanish civil society in the implementation of Resolution 1325. The second NAP expands on these goals by contextualizing the changing dynamics of international peace and security since the adoption of the country’s first NAP. Specifically, human rights and gender equality hold a more prevalent place in the revised NAP as well as links to the 2030 Agenda. Additionally, the second NAP expands its focus on disarmament by going beyond analyzing the issue from the narrow framework of disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) efforts alone, and instead identifies gender mainstreaming in the non-proliferation of small arms and light weapons as an action item among its objectives. Spain reported on the implementation of its NAP in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country included the following update: “The NAP provides for the creation of a Consultative Group composed of the Ministries involved and civil society organizations, which will hold regular meetings in order to, on the one hand, maintain the intensity in the implementation of the plan and, on the other hand, evaluate its results and adapt its application to new elements. The Plan also provides for follow-up reports to be submitted to Parliament every two years. Since the first follow-up report is due in 2019, information is currently being gathered on progress, activities carried out and the budget executed, and meetings are planned with both the Ministries involved and civil society” (p. 62) The most recent armed conflict in Spain’s history was its long-lasting conflict with ETA (an acronym for Euskadi ta Askatasuna [Basque Homeland and Liberty]), an armed separatist organization founded in 1959 with the aim to establish an independent Basque state. The conflict resulted in hundreds of casualties until ETA’s announcement of a unilateral ceasefire and its disbanding in 2011 and 2018, respectively. In 2019, Spain was among the top 20 countries with the highest military expenditure as well as being among the top 10 arms exporters in the world. Spain is a contributor to humanitarian aid, including as a contributing donor to the Women’s Peace and Humanitarian Fund , a global partnership that works to empower women in conflict zones and humanitarian crises. Spain is also a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies, a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. At the multilateral level, Spain most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2015-2016.",1984,8,2014,17B,"NAP Development
The NAP indicates that civil society has been included in the development of the NAP through meetings with representatives from key associations (research and study centers, development organizations, and feminist organizations and women’s associations) that work in the WPS field. 
Additionally, the following organizations have also contributed to the development of the NAP: Alianza Por la Solidaridad (APS); Centro de Estudios e Investigación sobre Mujeres (CEIM); Forum de Política Feminista (FpF); Mujeres en Zona de Conflicto (MZC); Human Rights Office, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (URJC); Real Instituto Elcano; Spanish Women in International Security (SWIIS); Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF España). 
The NAP was developed by an Interministerial Working Group that consists of the following ministries: Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation (MAEC), Ministry of Defence (MDEF), Ministry of Education, Culture and Sport (MECD), Ministry of the Economy, Industry and Competitiveness (MEIC), Ministry of the Interior (MINT), Ministry of Justice (MJUS), Ministry of Health, Social Services and Equality (MSSSI), and the Ministry of Employment and Social Security (MEYSS).
NAP Implementation
The NAP indicates that civil society organizations in Spain and their local counterparts in countries where the NAP will be implemented are key partners in implementing the NAP. However, the document does not specify which civil society organizations will be represented or how they will contribute to the implementation of the NAP. 
The NAP will be implemented by an Interministerial Working Group.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
The NAP implementation will be monitored by an Interministerial Working Group, which will also include representatives from civil society organizations. Civil society will also be represented on the consultative group, which will meet with the working group at least once a year.
The NAP implementation will be monitored by an Interministerial Working Group.",The implementation period of the NAP is six years (2017-2023).,"The NAP has four overarching objectives (which are then broken down to specific objectives on a detailed implementation matrix): 
Mainstream the gender perspective in peacebuilding and the prevention, management, and resolution of conflicts.
Achieve the significant participation of women in decision-making processes regarding the prevention, management and resolution of conflicts.
Guarantee the protection of, and respect for, the human rights of women and girls in conflict and post-conflict situations.
Effectively introduce gender mainstreaming into the definition of specific measures on reparations for, and the recovery of, conflict victims.","The NAP has a detailed implementation matrix that breaks down each overarching objective with corresponding specific objectives, actions, indicators, and actors. For example, objective 2.3, “Promote the participation of local women in the peace negotiation delegations of parties in conflict to ensure that women’s needs are included in peace agreements” lists “Promote, together with other coun-tries, the greater inclusion of local women in the delegations of parties negotiating peace in their countries” as an action item (p. 25). ","The NAP identifies several performance indicators for each objective, outlined on the implementation matrix. For example, objective 2.3, “Promote the participation of local women in the peace negotiation delegations of parties in conflict to ensure that women’s needs are included in peace agreements” lists “Number of meetings held with women and women’s associations by Embassies, Technical Cooperation Offices, and Counsellor’s Offices for specific sectors, broken down geographically” as one of the four indicators for this objective (p. 25).","The NAP indicates that a working group will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the action plan. The group will hold a plenary meeting at least once a year and will prepare a monitoring and assessment report every two years to be presented to the Spanish Parliament. However, the NAP does not include a formal monitoring and evaluation framework.","The NAP indicates that the action plan “will be carried out within the framework of the annual ordinary budget” (p. 44). However, the NAP does not include an estimated or allocated budget.","The NAP indicates that Spain’s revised action plan is a driving force behind “incorporating the principal of equal treatment and opportunities for women and men in the planning and implementation of activities for Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration” (p. 8). Additionally, disarmament is mentioned twice in the action items listed for objectives 4.1 and 4.4 (both objectives list the same action item): “Encourage gender mainstreaming in initiatives for disarmament and the non-proliferation of small arms and light weapons, as well as the participation of women in these initiatives” (pp. 31-32)."
Sri Lanka,,1981,115,,1.56B,"Development
From the outset, it was determined that the ownership of the NAP on WPS should extend beyond the Ministry of Women, Child Affairs and Social Empowerment to other ministries, government entities, non-government entities, and the general populace of Sri Lanka. It was also determined that the NAP should reflect ground realities of Sri Lankan women, with particular attention to those impacted by conflict. To this end, provincial consultative dialogues were conducted in all nine provinces of Sri Lanka. These provincial consultations convened stakeholders from all twenty-five administrative districts of Sri Lanka.14 These stakeholders included: 
State officials working at the village, divisional, district, and provincial levels 
Representatives of civil society organizations (CSOs), Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), International Non-Governmental Organizations (INGOs), and Community Based Organizations (CBOs) 
Victim survivors of conflict, military widows, FHHs, women with disabilities, survivors of sexual and gender-based violence, ex- combatants of the LTTE, women working in the estate sector or fisheries, women providing care for partners and/or children with disabilities.
The methodology of the provincial consultative dialogues aimed to enable coordination between GoSL and CSOs. To ensure that the data gathered was clear and distinct, the consultations were held separately for State officials and representatives of CSOs. The issues raised by each group were then shared with the other at the consultations, to build consensus between the GoSL and CSOs towards the collaborative implementation of the NAP. Many of the issues identified in the NAP on WPS and the actions proposed to address them were drawn from the valuable sharing of ideas that was facilitated during the provincial consultations. During this process, specific CSOs which were experienced in dealing with selected aspects of WPS were further consulted on their willingness to work with the State on implementing corresponding sections of the NAP, to which the response was largely favorable.
At the consultations, it was highlighted that effective coordination between State entities and the enhancement of inter-agency cooperation would not only lead to effective collaboration between State entities to achieve common goals, but that it would also reduce the duplication of tasks by state entities. This in turn, would lead to decreased costs around implementing various activities. The consultations also revealed the existing gaps relating to the WPS agenda which need to be addressed, and these have been translated into activities.
Implementation
Various agencies will be responsible for different activities in the NAP.
Monitoring and Evaluation
The Monitoring Framework for the NAP was developed within the frame of SDGs and inputs from diverse stakeholders at grassroots consultations. Two multi-agency and stakeholder coordinating bodies – Inter- Agency Coordination and Assessment Committee and National Core Steering Committee – will be established to oversee and fulfill key M&E responsibilities in parallel with the interventions. The Lead Implementing Agency for each activity will also conduct assessments. Each Coordination and Assessment Committee will be comprised of at least five persons with a limit of ten persons. The Coordination and Assessment Committee membership should include:
The convening agent representing the Lead Implementation Agency
One other member of the Lead Implementation Agency
At least one representative from each additional state actor identified for the relevant activity of the NAP
At least one representative from each non-state actor identified for the relevant activity 
At least one representative from Ministry of Women, Child Affairs and Social Empowerment in cases where the above does not comprise of a representative of the same
At least one representative from the Department for Project Management and Monitoring
One expert jointly identified and appointed by other Committee members
 ",The implementation period for the Sri Lanka NAP is 2023-2027.,"The NAP is expected to enable the achievement of the objectives below, through the implementation of activities detailed in the results framework:

Sudan Nap,,,,,,"NAP Development
Initial phases of development included consultations between the Ministry of Labour and Social Development with the Geneva Institute of Human Rights and preparatory meetings between the Ministry and the Institute with the Norwegian Embassy, and other Ministries. The NAP states that civil society organizations active in the field were also consulted and several national consultation workshops that included official and unofficial parties (including representatives of women’s organizations and of international organizations) were held throughout the phases of the development process.
NAP Implementation
The Ministry of Labor and Social Development is responsible for overseeing and coordinating the NAP’s implementation, with the Geneva Institute for Human Rights - Sudan Office as a partner body.  Each pillar of the NAP includes a list of implementing bodies, which includes various Ministries, such as the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Defense, civil society organizations, neighborhood change and services committees, universities and academic institutions, Women’s Commission, and the Central Bank of Sudan.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
The Ministry of Labour and Social Development is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the NAP.  Evaluation will be undertaken by a working group comprised of the Ministry of Labour and Social Development, university professors, representative of the Women and Gender Equity Commission, state ministries, representatives of the National Human Rights Commission, representatives of the Peace and Transitional Justice Commission and civil society organizations, assisted by the United Nations Women.",The implementation period for Sudan’s NAP is three years (2020-2022).,"The NAP focuses on three overarching objectives (p. 21):
Actively involving women in peace-building, peacekeeping, peace negotiations and decision-making processes at all levels, and in relief, reconstruction and development.  
Promoting the recognition of women’s rights before, during and post armed conflict. 
Ensuring the protection of women against any form of gender-based violence, such as rape and sexual slavery, and put an end to impunity.
Each of these overarching objectives is set out to be achieved through the four pillars of the WPS agenda; participation, prevention, protection, and relief and recovery.  Each of these four pillars has a set of goals that works toward the overarching objectives.  Additionally, each of these goals has an accompanying set of broad outcomes (p. 22-44).
For example, the third pillar, Protection, has six goals, which include (p. 32): 
Ensure that women and girls survivors of sexual violence have access to justice systems that enhance their dignity and psychological resilience. 
Outcome: Special measures in place that facilitate the access of victim survivors to the legal service and a transformation mechanism included in the regulations (p. 35)
Incorporating mental and reproductive health into primary health care. 
Outcome: Integrated services in place at the lower and primary levels in the all states of Sudan with a unified and community based approach (p. 37)",,"Each set of outcomes and related activities has a set of indicators (p. 22-44).  
For example, under the second pillar, Prevention, the goal of “Creating a social responsibility towards combatting violence against women and girls ” includes a long list of indicators such as (p. 30):
Educational curricula and school activities to combat violence
Number of trained imams, preachers, and priests who include combating violence against women and girls in their public address and preaching speeches
Number of grassroots communities engaged in anti-violence activities at the local level","Sudan’s NAP contains a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation plan.  Whilst the Ministry of Labour and Social Development will be responsible for monitoring using the qualitative and quantitative indicators provided, a working group made up of the Ministry of Labour and Social Development, university professors, representative of the Women and Gender Equity Commission, state ministries, representatives of the National Human Rights Commission, representatives of the Peace and Transitional Justice Commission and civil society organizations assisted by UN Women will be responsible for the evaluation process.  The working group will produce a study that assesses annual achievements with a corresponding report on goals achieved, failures and obstacles, as well as recommendations for the next stage.  This report will be used at a workshop, where all partners contributing to the implementation and follow-up will participate.","The NAP does not currently have a budget.  However, it states that implementation will be funded by the Norwegian Embassy in Khartoum (p. 13).","Pillar four of Relief and Recovery includes the goal of gender-sensitive Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR) programmes.  This includes meeting the needs of women ex-combatants, integration of gender perspectives within DDR and security sector reform programs, creating a society free from the threat and injury of landmines and light weapons, and involving women in small arms collection programs (p. 43-44)."
Sweden 2,"Sweden adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) for the period 2024-2028. Analysis is forthcoming. The 2016 NAP was developed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in coordination with a reference group, which consisted of several government agencies, civil society organizations, and research institutes. The NAP indicates civil society involvement in the NAP development, implementation, and monitoring process, with several women’s organizations, including Kvinna till Kvinna and WILPF, acting among the civil society representatives. Sweden’s NAP outlines four main objectives towards the implementation of UNSCR 1325. These include inclusive peace processes and peacebuilding; conflict prevention; strengthening protection of women and girls; and gender mainstreaming in leadership and expertise. The NAP outlines a monitoring and evaluation framework that consists of annual reviews, with a detailed implementation matrix and follow-up plan to be developed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Sweden’s NAP does not include an allocated budget, but indicates that “financing takes place within the framework of regular budget allocation” and that the identified activities to be carried out in focus countries “will be financed within the framework of Sweden’s international development cooperation” (p. 24). Sweden had previous NAPs, adopted in 2006 and 2009 and implemented for the period 2006-2008 and 2009-2012, respectively. While the second and third NAPs include a more detailed discussion and plan of implementation, a commitment to gender equality and human rights underpins all three NAPs. In a similar manner, all NAPs take a multi-tier approach to WPS implementation, including activities at the national, regional, and international level. Nevertheless, domestic activities mostly appear in the form of increasing the number of women in military and peacekeeping operations, without a more holistic approach. The second and third NAPs both include an overview of lessons learned from the implementation of the previous NAPs. Specifically, the second NAP states that there needs to be more cooperation and exchange, including increased awareness of Resolution 1325, at the national level, while the third NAP identifies the lack of clear allocation of responsibilities as an obstacle for implementation. While all NAPs highlight the importance of monitoring and financing, none of the NAPs have detailed monitoring and evaluation frameworks or an allocated budget. Sweden reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the report provides an overview of Sweden’s leadership in matters pertaining to women, peace, and security, underscoring the importance of representation and inclusivity for sustainable peace. The report identifies the integration of the WPS agenda as a priority for both domestic and international activities. In particular, the report states that Sweden held a pioneering role in the inclusion of information from women’s organizations in the UN Security Council’s analyses as well as contributing to the increased representation of women in peace processes, including in Afghanistan, Colombia, Mali, Myanmar, Somalia, and Syria (p. 56). Sweden does not have a history of recent armed conflict, but is involved in overseas military operations, international peacekeeping, and humanitarian missions. Sweden is a major contributor to humanitarian aid, including being a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies , a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. In 2019, Sweden was UN Women ’s second-largest contributor with USD 56.14 million and the third-largest contributor to regular resources with USD 13.05 million. Sweden is also a member of the Nordic Women Mediators Network, which was launched in 2015. In 2014, Sweden became the first country to adopt a feminist foreign policy , which identified six long-term objectives: women and girls’ full enjoyment of human rights; freedom from physical, psychological and sexual violence; participation in preventing and resolving conflicts, and post-conflict peacebuilding; political participation and influence in all areas of society; economic rights and empowerment; and sexual and reproductive health and rights. In 2019, Sweden also adopted a feminist trade policy , with the goal to ensure gender equality in trade agreements and all trade-related activities. At the multilateral level, Sweden most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2017-2018.",1980,4,2014,5.9B,,The timeframe encompasses 2016-2020.,"The Swedish NAP includes objectives from the previous two NAPs with the addition of a fourth:
A considerably larger proportion of women to participate in international peace-support and security-building operations, within the framework of regional and international organisations, and operations to be implemented with a gender perspective in order to increase their effectiveness.
The protection of women and girls in conflict situations to be strengthened and based on analysis in which women participate actively.
Women in conflict areas to participate fully and on equal terms with men at all levels in mechanisms and institutions for conflict prevention, crisis management, peace-building, humanitarian operations and other initiatives during a post-conflict phase.
Conflict prevention – include women and men to address structural root causes of conflict and violence.
Addionally, a geographic focus has been included in which an annual review by foreign missions in prioritised countries will contribute to overall reporting on the implementation of the action plan. These 12 countries include the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia, Mali, Somalia, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ukraine, Colombia, Iraq, Palestine and Syria.","The Swedish NAP's newly created fourth objective, Conflict Prevention, includes six new activities:
Contribute to ensure that women are included and that their experiences are taken into account in designing mechanisms and systems for early warning of conflicts and in conflict analyses. Also strive to ensure the inclusion of gender perspectives in measures intended to counteract and prevent conflict, radicalisation and violent extremism;
Support civil society organisations in conflict and post-conflict countries that are working on dialogue, trust-building measures and conflict prevention work, with a special focus on women’s rights organisations;
Contribute to developing the capacity of local government agencies and institutions that work on preventing violence and conflict and on maintaining security and safety among the population. Contribute to the inclusion of both women and men in this work;
Support programmes for economic recovery that strengthen women’s economic empowerment in conflict and post-conflict countries
Contribute to establishing greater participation of boys and men in conflict prevention work and measures to increase gender equality, and in counteracting gender-based violence – including conflict-related sexual violence; and
Contribute to ensuring that a gender perspective is integrated into discussions, final documents and relevant resolutions in the area of disarmament and arms control, and in their interpretation and implementation, particularly regarding small arms and light weapons.
Sweden's NAP splits its activities into three categories: nationally, in the EU and regional organisations such as the OSCE, the Council of Europe, NATO/the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council (EAPC) and Nordic cooperation, and globally, above all in the UN.
For example, under the second general aim, the Swedish NAP gives the following activities at the national level:
Special attention is to be paid, both in the short term and the long term, to issues concerning the security and protection of women and girls in operational areas, including the need for initiatives for sexual and reproductive health and rights.
The increased participation of women and respect for women's enjoyment of their human rights can help prevent gender-related violence, such as men'ss violence against women and girls, in a broader perspective. (Swedish Armed Forces, National Police Board, Folke Bernadotte Academy, Sida, Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency, Swedish National Defence College and Swedish Prison and Probation Service)
Special attention is to be paid to women's security when Sweden is directly involved in peace processes. Swedish men and women who represent the international community are to be encouraged to bear these issues in mind. The authorities responsible are to continuously evaluate and develop training for Swedish personnel who are to take part in international operations and peace assignments. All Swedish personnel that participate in peace-support and humanitarian operations must have knowledge of both Resolution 1325 and Resolution 1820, along with conditions specific to the operation, the relevant legislation and ethical issues. (Swedish Armed Forces, National Police Board, Folke Bernadotte Academy, Sida, Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency, Swedish National Defence College and Swedish Prison and Probation Service) There are to be continued and more in-depth efforts to integrate a clear gender equality perspective into initiatives to strengthen and secure the judicial system in post-conflict countries. (Swedish Armed Forces, National Police Board, Folke Bernadotte Academy, Sida, Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency, Swedish National Defence College, Swedish Prison and Probation Service, National Courts Administration and Swedish Prosecution Authority)","There are no specific indicators given in Sweden's NAP, however, a matrix for the implementation and followup of the action plan will be created by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and implementing government agencies. No timeframe is given for the matrix.","Keeping in line with previous NAPs, Sweden will hold annual reviews of implementation as a means of monitoring and evaluating in which the Ministry for Foreign Affairs will call those involved in the Government Offices, agencies and NGOs for discussions. When the action plan expires, an overall evaluation will be carried out with regard to the aims set in the plan.","The Swedish NAP states that the objective is for the budget to reach one per cent of Sweden’s gross national income, however, no commitment to that is evident. In previous NAPs, there is no allocated or estimated budget but the following language was used; ""The implementation of the plan will be financed within the framework of existing appropriations and funds and regular budget and other control processes.""","In the NAP's additional objective of conflict prevention, it addresses the need to ensure a gender perspective is included in discussions of disarmament and arms control, and in their interpretation and implementation, particularly regarding small arms and light weapons. Previous NAPs did not mention disarmament, small arms, or illicit trade of weapons and its effects on women."
Switzerland,"Switzerland adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2018 for the period 2018-2022. The NAP was developed by the Interdepartmental Working Group (IDWG 1325) in consultation with Swiss representations abroad, Swiss civil society, and partner organisations. Furthermore, the NAP incorporated the recommendations of the civil society report “1325 Reloaded” during the revision process. The NAP identifies five overarching goals: effective involvement of women in conflict prevention; women’s participation in and influence on conflict resolution and peace processes; protection against sexual and gender-based violence in conflict, refugee and migration contexts; women’s participation in peace missions and security policy; and multi- and bilateral commitment by Switzerland to women, peace and security. Furthermore, the fourth NAP includes a focus for greater participation by women in the prevention of violent extremism, since the passing of UNSCR 2242 (2015) as well as the incorporation of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5 on gender equality. The NAP includes an additional focus on engaging men in women, peace and security work as well as calling for greater consideration of gender aspects in arms control, disarmament, and non-proliferation. Each objective has corresponding actions and indicators as well as being accompanied by a monitoring and evaluation framework. The NAP does not have an allocated budget, but holds each organizational unit responsible for allocating a budget to their respective activities. Switzerland’s fourth NAP is preceded by three other NAPs, adopted in 2007, 2010, and 2013 and implemented for the period 2007-2009; 2010-2012; and 2013-2016, respectively. Switzerland’s engagement with the WPS agenda has become significantly more substantive with the adoption of its subsequent NAPs. Of particular notice is that each NAP begins with a section that provides an overview of the findings and recommendations from the implementation phases of prior NAPs. The second and third NAPs also have examples of NAP implementation, including a section on the Swiss government’s small arms strategy in the latter. Switzerland’s fourth NAP is unique in that it is the first time that civil society was included in the implementation of a NAP. The most recent NAP also has a slight expansion of its focus by not just approaching WPS implementation internationally, but also prioritizing the domestic country context with the goal to focus on the needs of women refugees in Switzerland. Switzerland reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country provided an overview of the novelties in their fourth NAP, while also elaborating on Switzerland’s engagement with activities and initiatives pertaining to women in conflict. Switzerland does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but plays an important role in international humanitarian and development operations. Switzerland has a long-standing policy of military neutrality and has a national Peace Policy , which focuses on the implementation of the country’s long-standing commitment to the promotion of peace worldwide. Nevertheless, in 2019, Switzerland was among the top 40 countries with the highest military expenditure as well as being among the top 15 arms exporters in the world. Furthermore, Switzerland has mandatory military service for all able-bodied male citizens of the country as well as having the highest rate of firearm ownership in Europe and the third highest in the world. Switzerland is a contributor to humanitarian aid, including being a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies , a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. In 2019, Switzerland was UN Women ’s second-largest contributor of regular resources with USD 16.03 million and the seventh-largest contributor of total resources with USD 19.36 million. At the multilateral level, Switzerland is a candidate for a non-permanent seat at the United Nations Security Council for the period 2023-2024.",1997,18,2015,5B,"NAP Development
Civil society formed part of the development of the NAP through consultations. 
WILPF Switzerland was not involved in the development of the NAP.
The NAP was developed by members of the IDWG 1325 such as the Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA), the Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport (DDPS), the Federal Department of Home Affairs (FDHA) and the Federal Department of Justice and Police (FDJP) as well as Civil Society (CS).
NAP Implementation
Civil society is involved in the implementation of NAP 1325 through a specific project which aims among other things to raise awareness among policymakers and the public.
The Interdepartmental Working Group 1325 (IDWG 1325), headed by the FDFA’s Human Security Division, is responsible for implementing the measures during the 2018–22 period. 
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
Civil society is mentioned to be part of the evaluation process through a participatory process.  
The IDWG meets at least twice a year to review implementation, exchange knowledge and if necessary adapt the NAP. ",The fourth NAP is to be implemented in a period of five years 2018-2022.,"UPDATE-2018: The main goals of the 2018-2022 NAP are:
Effective involvement of women in conflict prevention

5) Mainstreaming “Women, Peace and Security” in the federal administration
Each goal is broken down by subordinate goals: 
Multilateral policy
Switzerland’s personnel policy
Bilateral activities and peace policy programmes as well as programmes for fragile states
Switzerland's second revised NAP has three main goals:
1) Greater participation of women in peacebuilding.
2) Prevention of gender-based violence and protection of the needs of and rights of women and girls.
3) A gender sensitive approach to all peacebuilding projects and programs.","UPDATE-2018: Switzerland’s 2018-2022 NAP has various activities assigned to achieve its objectives.

Tajikistan,"Tajikistan adopted its most recent National Action Plan (NAP) in 2019, for the period 2019-2022. The NAP has been submitted for approval to the Executive Office of the President of the Republic of Tajikistan. Tajikistan’s second NAP is preceded by one other NAP, adopted in 2014 and implemented for the period 2014-2018. WILPF’s analysis of the NAPs will be posted following the public release of both documents. Tajikistan reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the report indicated that “the [second] NAP recognizes the lessons learned from the previous document and should be regarded as commitments of the Government of Tajikistan in such areas as human rights, gender equality and empowerment of women, conflict prevention, conflict resolution and peace-building” (p. 58). The report states that the drafting of the NAP began in 2018 through a three-day training, conducted with the support of UN Women and the assistance of an international expert on Women, Peace, and Security, for government representatives responsible for the NAP implementation as well as representatives from non-governmental organizations working on gender. The collaboration at this training resulted in the drafting of Tajikistan’s revised NAP. Tajikistan gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. The most recent armed conflict in the country’s history was the civil war , which took place from 1992 until 1997 and resulted in thousands of casualties and displaced people. Women were excluded from the peace process . Tajikistan also experiences border disputes with Kyrgyzstan, and most recently, there were local clashes along the Tajik-Krygyz border as a result of disputes over access to natural resources.",1993,137,,,,,,,,,,
Timor Leste,"Timor–Leste adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2016 for the period 2016-2020 and its most recent for the period 2024-2028. The 2016 NAP was developed by the Ministry of the Interior, with support from UN Women, and through a participatory multi-stakeholder process that was initiated by the Secretary of State for Security in 2013. The NAP’s objectives are developed to align with the primary pillars of the Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) agenda, focusing on participation, prevention, protection, and peacebuilding. The NAP is developed based on the lessons and experiences of women and men as a result of Timor-Leste’s occupation, and reaffirms that although the war is over, women continue to struggle to achieve justice and equal rights today. As such, the NAP includes concrete actions to review and improve laws, policies and programs for enhancing women’s active and meaningful participation in all aspects of peace and state-building. Furthermore, the NAP contributes to implementing key recommendations of the Commission of Reception, Truth and Reconciliation (CAVR) report, which documented the systematic abuses and sexual and gender-based violence committed by members of the Indonesian armed forces. While the NAP has a detailed implementation matrix, it does not include an allocated budget. Timor-Leste reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the report indicates that the NAP “is a transformative gender policy focused on how to develop more equal relationships between females and males in areas including the separation of power, resource control, decision-making, social and political statutes, and access to justice and security. This policy provided strategies and concrete actions to enhance East Timorese women’s participation in peace building, state building, conflict resolution and the development process” (pp. 14-15). Timor-Leste declared independence from Portugal in 1975, when it was then occupied by Indonesia. The country continued to experience two decades of armed conflict and political tension until a referendum resulted in favor of Timor-Leste’s independence in 1999. Due to the volatile political situation and ongoing tension in the country, the United Nations Transitional Administration (UNTAET) served as a temporary governance structure in Timor-Leste until the country became a sovereign state in 2002. Currently, women’s organizations in the country play a key role in addressing systemic inequalities and driving social change.",2003,117,,34.4M,"The analysis in these tabs corresponds to the 2016 NAP.
NAP Development
Timor–Leste’s 2016-2020 National Action Plan for the implementation of UNSCR 1325(2000) is the results of a participatory multi-stakeholder process, with participation of civil sociey, that was initiated by the Secretary of State for Security in 2013.
The Government has demonstrated great commitment to the full inclusion of women in matters of peacebuilding and security by adopting United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, on Women, Peace and Security. The Ministry of the Interior, following the initiative of the former Secretary of State for Security, within the 5th Constitutional Government, with the support of UN Women, has led the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste to develop its National Action Plan (NAP) on UNSCR 1325 on Women, Peace and Security.
NAP Implementation
Civil society organisations will support implementation and monitoring of NAP on UNSCR 1325 activities, advocate resource allocation and implementation of the plan, and develop shadow reporting on progress achieved.
The success of the implementation of the NAP on UNSCR 1325 - Women, Peace and Security (WPS) will depend on the political commitment by the leadership of this Government. Therefore, the implementation of this NAP must placed in the trust of the Government.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
Civil society organisations will support implementation and monitoring of NAP on UNSCR 1325 activities, advocate resource allocation and implementation of the plan, and develop shadow reporting on progress achieved.
The NAP says that the Ministry of Interior is responsible for the overall leadership and implementation of the Timor-Leste NAP on UNSCR 1325 (2016-2020). However, there is no clear plan for monitoring and evaluation.",The implementation period for the National Plan of Action is six years (2016-2020).,"Based on the specific context analysis for Timor-Leste and with the strong support and commitment of all stakeholders, a series of specific objectives were formulated for the National Action Plan on UNSCR 1325 for Timor-Leste, organised around the four pillars - or four P’s – of Participation, Prevention, Protection and Peacebuilding.","Each pillar has different actions assigned. For example, Pillar 2 (Prevention) includes the following action points:
Develop and integrate materials for gender, human rights, treaties and conventions (CEDAW, UNSCR regarding Women, Peace and Security, humanitarian law, HIBV/AIDS awareness etc.) in security, justice and defense institutions training centres;
Develop specialised courses for defense, security and justice personnel regarding gender equality, human rights, HIV/AIDS awareness, including information about reproductive health in defence and security training centers;
Training about protection of civilians, including their rights and needs, particularly of women’s inclusion in peace-keeping operations and peacebuilding and also awareness raising about HIV/AIDS for peace-keeping forces prior to deployment;
Conduct gender reviews in debates/ discussions of existing laws, policies, plans and strategies relating to conflict prevention and conduct socialisation for the community/public from the national level to rural areas;
Evaluate and revise the conflict early warning system and disaster and conflict escalation risk reduction system and to include/ incorporate further gender sensitive indicators and monitoring mechanisms;
Dissemination about, early warning systems to local authorities, community leaders, including Suco Council members and other community members particularly women, youth and minority groups;
Training for mediators (men and women) to have knowledge of conflict resolution with a gender perspective (including MSS mediators);

Civic education including gender sensitive non-violent conflict resolution integrated into primary and secondary school curricula;
Conduct consultation with civil society and the parliament including women’s organisations to be able to ensure that law and policies relating to traditional conflict prevention/traditional (barlake) customs are gender sensitive;
Conduct dialogues with women at the community level to identify the causes and consequences of practices that regulate traditional practices including reducing the # of barlake;
Socialisation of the land and property laws approved by the NP to inform people about legal rights including compensation policies for communities, particularly for women’s access and rights to land and property when the government undertakes mega-projects e.g. ZEESM (Special Economic Zone for the Social Market Timor-Leste Oecusse, South Coast and Covalima);

Togo,"Togo adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2011 for the period 2011-2016. The NAP does not specify which government entity was responsible for the development of the NAP. The NAP identifies its overall objective as increasing women’s participation in all levels of decision-making in conflict prevention, management, and resolution as well as in peacebuilding processes. The NAP additionally identifies short, medium, and long-term objectives, only some of which have corresponding indicators. The monitoring and evaluation framework of the NAP consists of periodical meetings of the Steering Committee, which consists of women civil society organizations and pertinent government entities, mid-term review of the activities, and monitoring reports. The NAP does not have an allocated budget. Togo reported on the implementation of its NAP in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the country indicated that it had adopted a NAP for the period 2018-2022 (p. 61). Togo gained independence from France in 1960, after an extensive period of colonial rule under the German, British, and French empires. Togo does not have a recent history of armed conflict, but experienced multiple military coups throughout its history. In 2019, Togo was among the top 5 countries in the world with the biggest increase in their military expenditure, with a 70% increase in its military spending. Togo is also a major contributor to peacekeeping operations. At the multilateral level, Togo most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2012-2013.",1983,110,2015,171M,"NAP Development
Women’s organizations and some unions have been involved in the NAP development, however, it does not indicate which organizations. 
The NAP development process is not described in detail. The Togo Government has been involved in the NAP development, but there is no information as to the bodies who drafted the NAP. To be noted that the UN has also contributed to drafting the NAP.
NAP Implementation
Women’s organizations will be responsible for the implementation of some of the NAP activities, together with development partners and some government agencies, however, the NAP does not specify which women’s organizations will be involved.
The Government and the Parliament will be responsible for implementing some of the NAP activities, however, the NAP does not say which Government bodies will be involved. A committee will be created within a Ministry (although not specified yet) to coordinate the implementation of the NAP and facilitates the activities of the actors involved in the implementation process.
NAP Monitoring and evaluation
Women’s organizations will be part of the committee that will be created especially for monitoring the NAP implementation, however, the NAP does not specify which women’s organizations will be involved.
The Ministry that will have created the implementation committee will be part of a second committee, especially created to monitor the NAP implementation.",The NAP has a five-year lifetime (2011-2016) and may be revised after two years and during the last year. A table states the period and implementation deadline for each activity. The earliest implementation steps were expected to happen in September 2011 and the latest are expected to be processed at the end of the NAP lifetime.,"The NAP has one general objective and three specific objectives broken down by timeframe.
The general objective of the NAP is to “increase women’s participation in at all levels of the decision-making process, especially in conflict prevention, management and resolution as well as in peacekeeping processes”.
The NAP has the following specific objectives:
Short-term objective (6 months):
Foster efficient and sustainable solutions promoting negotiations as a mean to solve conflicts and issues on the long-term
Mid-term objectives (18 months):
Support stakeholders’ ownership of the NAP and dialogue between stakeholders.
Conduct advocacy with national authorities to guarantee the NAP is adopted and UNSCR1325 and UNSCR 1820 are implemented in close cooperation with involved stakeholders
Develop women’s values and know-how relative to peace, dialogue promotion and consensus building in decision-making processes (especially in political processes)
Advocate for women’s inclusion in peace support missions
Value women’s competences in negotiation techniques, peaceful conflict management and traditional ethics and strategies for conflict solving.
Ensure national policies include measures dedicated to empowering women and giving them the ability to work on conflict prevention and peace promotion
Long-term objectives (between 18 months and 5 years):
Support and contribute to the reforming program for the security sector in Togo as well as to reducing the circulation of small arms
Study the root causes of recent violence inherent in the national political system, lead research studies on local practices and traditions relative to conflict solving and tolerance promotion.","The NAP relies on the following activities:
Commemorating all days related to gender or gender-based violence
Promoting and contributing to the national policy on UNSCR1325 and UNSCR1820
Promoting peace culture
Integrating gender issues in decision-making processes","The NAP indicates quantifiable indicators for only some activities which include:
Gender-based violence repression rate;
Number of educator clubs created;
Number of women ready (i.e. trained and operational) to work as peace and security mediators;
Number of women involved in peace infrastructures, government institutions and public administrations;
Number of women sensitized to and engaged in decision-making  and political processes;
Rate of women’s participation in public life;
Number of women involved in the government; constitutional council and parliament.","The monitoring process of the NAP will be performed through periodical meetings of the Steering Committee, mid-term review of the activities, execution and monitoring reports. A committee, composed of women leaders from civil society organizations, representatives of the Ministry that will be designated to be in charge of this project, and development partners will be in charge of the monitoring process. This committee will collaborate with the stakeholders involved in the NAP implementation.","No budget is explicitly specified in the NAP. Nevertheless, financial resources are mentioned as being critical to achieve the objectives of the NAP. The NAP gives some information as to resource mobilization via lobbying, but this applies to the whole set of resources that will be necessary to implement the NAP and does not focus on financial resources.
The NAP states that an expert committee -composed of government members, civil society organizations and development partners- will gather to discuss resource mobilisation (no particular information on financing resources).","The NAP only states that one of its long-term objectives is to “support and contribute to [...] reducing the circulation of small arms”. However, the NAP does not address disarmament issues in its actions and does not connect the proliferation of weapons to women's insecurity."
Tunisia,"Tunisia adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in 2018 for the period 2018-2022. The NAP is currently available only in Arabic. WILPF’s analysis of the NAP will be posted following an English translation. Tunisia reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64 (2020). Specifically, the report stated that the NAP focuses on “empowering women and girls; promoting their participation in building sustainable peace and stability; contributing to the elimination of all forms of gender-based discrimination and working to immunize society against the dangers of conflict, extremism and terrorism” (p. 43). Tunisia gained independence from France in 1956, after decades of colonial rule by the French empire. In 2010, Tunisia experienced a series of protests, which emanated from entrenched social and economic inequalities in the country, resulting in the beginning of the Arab Spring. Women played a key role in these protests as well as being pivotal in the development of the Tunisian National Action Plan. In 2019, Tunisia was among the top 10 countries in the world with the biggest increase in their military expenditure, with a 23% increase in its military spending. At the multilateral level, Tunisia is currently an elected member of the Security Council (2020-2021).",1985,124,,1B,,,,,,,,
Uganda,"Uganda adopted its third National Action Plan (NAP) in 2021 for the period 2021-2025. It is preceded by two others, for the periods 2008-2010 and 2011-2015. In 2008, Uganda adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP). The NAP was developed by the Ministry of Gender Labor and Social Development and constitutes a part of a broader national strategic framework on the advancement of women; in particular, the five year National Action Plan on Women (2007) which set out priorities in peacebuilding, conflict resolution and the rights of women and girls to live free from violence. Relatedly, the NAP addresses the gendered impacts of small arms and light weapons as well as referencing Uganda’s arms control and disarmament measures.  A second NAP was adopted for the period 2011-2015. A participatory development process was formulated as a roadmap to NAP III in January 2019, informed by the review and evaluation of the two previous Ugandan NAPs, as well as UN Women’s 2015 global study on the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325.  The NAP is implemented through a localisation strategy that is people-focused and bottom-up.  Rather than a prescriptive tool, it is intended to be ‘an essential guiding tool for different sectors’ (p. 31) including governmental ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs), NGOs and cultural institutions.  NAP III focuses on four core goals: all forms of violence prevented and conflicts resolved; good governance enhanced at all levels; natural and human-made disasters prevented and mitigated; systems and structures for the implementation and coordination of the NAP III strengthened. It has a comprehensive and detailed Monitoring and Evaluation Plan based on annual reporting from civil society, MDAs and district local governments, as well as a mid-term evaluation in 2023.  It also has an estimated total budget of 90,570,166,912 UGX . Uganda reported on the implementation of its NAP, as well as WPS commitments, in its national reporting for Beijing+25 and in preparation for CSW64. Specifically, Uganda stated that the country conducted an evaluation of the NAP, and a multi- stakeholder technical committee to develop a successor national action plan was put in place. The identified legal priority areas of the NAP were legal and policy frameworks; improved access to health and medical services and psychosocial services for GBV victims/survivors; women in leadership and decision making and prevention of GBV in Society; and budgetary allocations for implementation on UNSCR 1325. Local governments also developed and implemented peace action plans with support from civil society organizations. In the implementation of the plans, community members were assigned roles in conflict analysis, early warning, prevention and response. Uganda gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1962, after decades of colonial rule by the British Empire. Uganda experienced a military dictatorship from 1971 until 1979, a civil war, which lasted from 1980 until 1986, as well as a protracted conflict between the government and the Lord’s Resistance Army , ongoing since 1987. Women have been deliberately targeted with sexual violence during these conflicts, and a study on displaced and conflict-affected populations in Uganda found that women were twice as likely to demonstrate systems of PTSD as well as being four times as likely to show systems of depression. In 2019, Uganda was among the top 5 countries in the world with the biggest increase in their military expenditure, with a 52% increase in its military spending. At the multilateral level, Uganda most recently served as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council for the period 2009-2010.",1985,65,,646M,"NAP Development
The Ministry of Gender, Labour and Social Development (MGLSD), with support from UN Women and the Royal Norwegian Embassy in Uganda, developed a roadmap to developing NAP III.
Prior to the full drafting, MGLSD and UN Women secured the commitment of 28 key government MDAs, religious and cultural institutions, civil society organizations (CSOs), UN Agencies, the media, academia and private sector actors to take part in the development and implementation of the NAPIII.
NAP Implementation
NAP will be implemented through a localisation strategy across different sectors including  government ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs), such as the Ministry of Health, and Parliament; local governments; non-governmental organisation (NGOs) and women’s organizations; community-based organization (CBOs); the media; faith-based organisations (FBOs); cultural institutions; academia and research institutions; donor agencies and development partners; security sector.
Localisation, introduced by CSOs, allows for local ownership and participation for better policy-making and implementation.  Whilst each MDA and CSO has designed operational plans specifying the interventions they will carry out to contribute to NAP III, the MGLSD will be to ensure the coordination of all MDAs and CSOs involved in its implementation.  MGLSD will also design its own operational plans in line with NAP III’s framework.
NAP monitoring and evaluation
The Monitoring and Evaluation Plan will be led by MGLSD, and supported by the Office of Prime Minister (OPM). The National Technical Committee (NTC) will provide technical guidance.
Civil society, MDAs and district local governments will also be invited for annual reporting on their progress.",The implementation period for Uganda’s NAP is five years (2021-2025).,"The NAP focuses on fifteen medium-term outcomes categorized under four core outcomes.
Core outcome 1: All forms of violence prevented and conflicts resolved (p. 21)
Medium-term outcomes: 
Social cohesion is enhanced
Land related conflicts reduced 
Election related violence reduced 
Inter-ethnic conflicts reduced and peaceful co-existence and cohesion in communities promoted
Core outcome 2: Good governance enhanced at all levels (p. 23)
Medium-term outcomes: 
Increased participation of women in decision making in the security sector 
Social, cultural, and religious norms, values, practices, and perceptions aligned to human rights standards 
Women’s involvement in dialogues on issues for women peace and security increased
Core outcome 3: Natural and human-made disasters prevented and mitigated (p. 25)
Medium-term outcomes: 
Increased women’s involvement in environment conservation, natural resource management and climate change mitigation
Improved meaningful participation of women refugees and host communities in decision making for peaceful co-existence 
Increased participation of women in reduction of violent extremism 
Increased women’s leadership in the prevention and mitigation of emerging viral diseases in vulnerable communities
Core outcome 4: Systems and structures for the implementation and coordination of the NAP III strengthened (p. 27)
Medium-term outcomes: 
NAP III costed and sufficiently resourced
Effective NAP III Coordination mechanisms are established 
Progress on NAP III implementation is regularly and effectively communicated
Key actors are mobilized and engaged in the implementation of the NAP","Each of the four core outcomes has a set of strategic interventions whilst each of the fifteen medium-term outcomes has a set of outputs.
For example, core outcome 3: ‘Natural and human made disasters prevented and mitigated’ includes a list of strategic interventions such as (p. 26):
Promote and support women’s access to climate change related information and information on environmental conservation technologies 
Empower women in refugee settlements and host communities to take on leadership roles and participate in interventions that promote peaceful coexistence. 
Support women groups to gain knowledge and skills in detecting and preventing violent extremism and provide psychosocial support to families affected by violent extremism
Outcome 3 also contains 4 medium-term outcomes, including ‘Increased women’s leadership in the prevention and mitigation of emerging viral diseases in vulnerable communities’.  Outputs for this medium-term goal are (p. 25): 
Increased knowledge and awareness among women for the prevention and management of emerging viral diseases
Strengthened capacity of actors in gender responsive prevention and mitigation of emerging viral diseases.","Each core outcome, as well as each subset of medium-term outcomes, are given a set of performance indicators, indicator definition and method of analysis, source of information / means of verification, and contributing partner.
For example, Medium-term Outcome 1.4: ‘Interethnic conflicts reduced and peaceful co-existence and cohesion in communities promoted’, has the following (p. 45):
Performance indicator: Level of involvement of women in peacebuilding processes 
Indicator definition, method of analysis: Indicator tracks how women are influencing peacebuilding efforts through their participation in peacebuilding processes, including raising awareness, mediation, negotiation.
Source of information/verification: Perception survey reports
Contributing partners: MIA, MGLSD, CSO","The Monitoring and Evaluation Plan, led by MGLSD, and supported by the OPM and the NTC, is based upon annual reporting by civil society, MDAs and district local governments on their progress.  There will also be a mid-term evaluation in 2023 to assess whether outcomes are being achieved and if any adjustment to the activities is required.  An in-depth external evaluation will be conducted in the final year of implementation, with a new NAP developed from its recommendations.
Performance indicators, which are mostly quantitative, are clearly laid out for each core outcome and medium-term outcome under the Monitoring and Evaluation Plan.  The source of information or means of verification, and contributing partners facilitate the monitoring and evaluation of NAP III by providing sources to assess progress toward indicators and the actors involved.  The medium-term goals and their indicators will be assessed in the 2023 mid-term evaluation.","The output of each medium-term outcome is given an estimated cost in the Ugandan Shilling (UGX), along with a subtotal for each outcome.  
For example, under core outcome 2: ‘Good governance enhanced at all levels’, medium-term Outcome 1 is ‘Increased participation of women in decision making in the Security sector’ has the following costs associated (p. 38):  
Gender policies across all security sector institutions passed: 2,035,000,000 UGX
Increased knowledge and awareness of security sector leadership on the transformative role of women’s participation: 827,068,000 UGX
Systems and structures for the implementation of gender policies in security sector institutions are strengthened: 750,000,000 UGX
Monitoring and evaluation is also allocated a cost of 2,682,923,648 UGX.  The total budget comes to 90,570,166,912 UGX.","Disarmament is addressed briefly in the context of women’s participation.  Women’s CSOs participation in disarmament programmes is discussed as an indicator of the outcome ‘Women involvement in dialogues on issues of women, peace and security increased’.  
Under situation analysis, NAP III identified that the National Focal Point on Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, is addressing issues of SGBV, indicating that Ugandan officials are already focused to some degree on the gendered impacts of arms and weapons.  This seems to flow naturally from highlighting and addressing the link in the first NAP.  However, NAP III itself does not address SALW, SALW control measures, disarmament, nor the gendered implications of weapons proliferation."
Ukraine,"Ukraine published a second National Action Plan (NAP) for the period 2020-2025 after its first NAP, for the period 2016-2020, came to an end. At the end of 2022, however, amidst the ongoing full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Government of Ukraine launched an initiative to revise their NAP to reflect on the WPS agenda in practice, and learn from prior government initiatives and civil society in how to best update and implement the plan within the changing conflict context. The new NAP, in writing, is a copy of the original 2020-2025 NAP but includes changes noted by: { As amended by the Order of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine No.1150-r dated 16.12.2022}. This NAP therefore still has the name end date as the NAP published in 2020, meaning the implementation period is now 2022-2025. The NAP was developed through joint efforts between different national institutions reporting to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine. The NAP approaches the implementation of the Women, Peace and Security (WPS) agenda primarily domestically, with an expected focus on the ongoing war. However, it does apply an international lens to issues such as ensuring the training and selection of women for participation in international peacekeeping, as well as peace negotiations. The NAP includes five strategic goals: participation of women in decision-making; resilience to security challenges; post-conflict recovery and transitional justice; combatting gender-based violence and conflict-related sexual violence; and institutional capacity of the national plan actors. Within these strategic goals, operational goals are also identified, which include a ‘task title’, ‘activity title’, the actor(s) responsible for implementation, the time frame for implementation, the source of financing, and the estimated financial resources required for task implementation. The monitoring and evaluation framework for the NAP involved analyzing the key achievement of key indicators and their deviation from target values, determining the reason for their deviation, and conducting an analysis of the implementation status of the tasks and activities in the NAP (p. 13). The collection of information of the indicators’ achievement is stated to be the responsibility of central executive bodies, other state bodies involved in the implementation of the NAP, the Council of Ministers of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, regional state administrations, and the Kyiv and Sevastopol City State Administrations (p.13). The updated NAP includes a slight change in the problem analysis, as well as updated objectives, main target groups and principles of the NAP. The key difference in the problem analysis is outlining issues that have arisen since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation. It highlights how since then, almost one third of Ukrainians have been forced to leave their homes, and details how this mass displacement disproportionately impacts the lives of women due to the burden of caring for children and other family members requiring care (p.4). An increase in gender-based violence, including conflict-related sexual violence, has also been added to the problem analysis, noting that multiple cases have been perpetrated by military personnel of the Russian Federation in all territories of Ukraine that have been liberated (p.5). The NAP then states that Ukraine does not currently have  effective mechanisms to identify security challenges that consider gender aspects, nor is there capacity to inform the wider population about any such issues that arise (p.5). As a result of the change in context, the main target groups and principles were also adjusted. This included referencing the importance of addressing issues relating to: internally displaced persons; persons with limited mobility that live close to the contact line; persons living in combat areas; persons released from captivity; persons staying in temporarily occupied territories; close relatives of combatants or prisoners of war; victims of human trafficking; persons who became disabled due to combat related actions; and persons who suffered material losses due to combat. Essentially, the NAP created a more expansive list of whom it would focus on in recognition of the changed context and the shifting needs of different populations. There is no mention of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) in the NAP, nor is there reference to any wider weapons or armament policies. Given the global concern around arms-control and disarmament relating the war, as well as the general consensuses that increased arms availability makes adhering to international law more difficult and also facilitates and aggravates violence against women and girls , the omission of policies that mention this means that these issues remain unaddressed in the NAP.",1981,66,2014,44B,"NAP Development  
According to the document, Ukraine’s NAP was developed in accordance with national laws on gender equality, the sustainable development goals, and Resolution 1325 on Women, Peace and Security. However, there is no explicit mention of which actors participated in the development of the NAP.  
NAP Implementation  
The Ministry of Social Policy in Ukraine is the body that is primarily responsible for the implementation of the NAP. The NAP also includes a comprehensive list of other actors that are responsible, including but not limited to various ministries (the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education and Science), actors in the security and defense sectors, educational institutions, city administrations, civil associations and international organizations (p.8). Additionally, for each activity title throughout the NAP, a corresponding  actor responsible for implementation is listed.  
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation  
Monitoring of the NAP will be primarily carried out by the Ministry of Social Policy, with information provided by central executive bodies, other state bodies involved in the implementation of the NAP, the Council of Ministers of the Autonomous region of Crimea, regional state administrations, and the Kyiv and Sevastopol City State Administrations (p.13). Together they will collect information on the achievement of indicators set out in the NAP, as well as operational and strategic goals of the NAP. ",The NAP implementation period is 2022-2025.,"The 2022-2025 NAP identifies five strategic goals that set the vision for Ukraine’s WPS implementation strategy. They include: 
Participation of Women in Decision-Making: ensuring the equal participation of women and men in decision-making on conflict prevention, conflict resolution an post-conflict recovery at all levels and in all areas, including the security and defence sector  
Resilience to Security Challenges: Creating a gender-sensitive system to detect, prevent and respond to security challenges. This involves creating effective mechanisms of interactions of state bodies, public associations, and organizations to respond to security challenges in a way that considers the needs of different groups  
Post-Conflict Recovery and Transitional Justice: Ensuring the process of post-conflict recovery, development and implementation of the transitional justice system based on the principles of ensuring equal rights and opportunities for women and men  
Combating Gender-Based Violence and Conflict-Related Sexual Violence: Providing protection against gender-based violence and sexual violence (in situations of armed conflict and in peacetime) 
Institutional Capacity of the National Plan Actors: Ensuring the developed institutional capacity of the National Plan actors for the effective implementation of the Women, Peace and Security agenda in accordance with international standards  ","Strategic outcomes have a comprehensive set of tasks assigned. These are outlined starting from page 16 of the NAP. It outlines each strategic goal, lists tasks that correspond to this goal, as well as the actor(s) responsible, the time frame for implementation, and the breakdown of the budget for each year of the NAP.  ","Each strategic goal has various indicators attached to it. For example, for Goal 1, “ensuring equal participation of women and men in decision-making on conflict prevention, conflict resolution, and post-conflict reconstruction at all levels and in all areas”, the following indicators are listed:  
Ukraine’s place in the UN Women, Peace and Security Index  
The share of women in the security and defense sector  
The share of women in management positions in the defense sector  
The proportion of women participating in international peacekeeping operations in the national contingent  
The proportion of women involved in peace negotiations at the national level  
The number of programs on humanitarian response, peacebuilding and restoration, which were implemented by civil society organizations led by women  
Each indicator is listed alongside a department/group/organization that is responsible for sourcing the information, as well as a section devoted to “the results of the analysis of factors that had a positive impact on the achievement of progress, or the reasons for the decrease in value of the indicator”.  ","The NAP states that the actors that have been outlined will submit information on the achievement of the indicators of the operational and strategic goals to the Ministry of Social Policy on an annual basis. The ministry will then finalize the information and submit it to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine indicating: the current status of NAP implementation; the share of the indicators and goals achieved; a list of major achievements, as well as areas of concern; and proposals for solving areas of concern (p.14). The NAP also includes the fact that the plan can be updated, if necessary, based on the annual results. The final evaluation of the NAP is expected to be performed during the last year of its implementation, in particular through the following considerations (p.11):  
Analysis of the impact of the NAP’s implementation on the living conditions of target groups  
Analysis of the achieved key indicators towards the overall goal of the NAP, their deviation from planned markets, and investigation of the reasons for such deviation  
Analysis of the reasonableness and validity of the selected tools for implementation of the NAP, the identified approaches and the need for their revision or extension  
Analysis of the NAP’s impact on the situation of target groups  ",There is no budget indicated in the NAP.,"Ukraine’s NAP does not address disarmament issues, or connect the proliferation of weapons with women’s insecurity. "
Uae Nap,,,,,,"Actors 
The NAP outlines a variety of actors responsible for its development and implementation. Each group of actors respond to the objectives outlined in the NAP framework. For the integration of women into foreign policy priorities, including humanitarian aid for women and girls, the responsible Ministries are: Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Ministry of Defense, General Women’s Union, and civil society institutions. On the other hand, activities relating to women’s participation in peacekeeping forces and within the security sector falls under the responsibility of the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, General Women’s Union, and UN Women Liaison office for GCC. 
Civil society institutions are mentioned as relevant and responsible for the implementation process of the NAP, however there is no clarity of the role they will play in them. In addition, the General Women’s Union is mentioned throughout most objectives as a relevant actor. 
Development
The UAE entities involved in the preparation of the National Action Plan were the Federal National Council, the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Interior, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, the Ministry of Culture and Youth, the Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health and Prevention, the Ministry of Justice, the National Emergency Crisis and Disaster Management Authority, the General Authority For Islamic Affairs and Endowments, the General Women's Union, the UAE Gender Balance Council, thel Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Centre, and UN Women.
Implementation
As the United Arab Emirates considers that the Action Plan should articulate a government’s commitment and priorities regarding women, peace, and security, government institutions are responsible for the execution of the NAP at all levels, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Culture and Youth, the Federal Competitiveness and Statistics Authority, the General Women's Union, and other relevant authorities. 
M&E
The Emirati NAP does not outline mechanisms for monitoring and evaluation, nor allocates responsible actors for such tasks.
Civil Society
Even though the document states that civil society and the private sector are relevant to the WPS Agenda and participated in the development of the NAP, further information is not provided about which activities they would be a part of.",The timeframe for the implementation of the NAP is from 2021 to 2024.,"UAE recognizes four main objectives that are the core of the NAP:
Women's needs are integrated into foreign policy priorities, including humanitarian aid for women and girls
Women’s meaningful participation in promotion of conflict prevention and participation in peacebuilding activities is increased
Women’s meaningful participation in peacekeeping forces and within the security sector is strengthened, and peacekeeping troops deployed have a strengthened capacity to protect women from sexual exploitation and abuse during deployment
Women’s meaningful participation in preventing violent extremism and other emerging women, peace, and security challenges is strengthened.","Each objective in the Emirati NAP has secondary objectives that must be reached through different proposed actions. Example of these include: 
Objective 1
Women’s political participation in UAE is strengthened: Conduct training to enhance women’s leadership and governance skills broadly in UAE, create peer-to-peer and mentorship relationships between women within Ministries and Governmental entities, set annual targets for total number of women in senior-level positions at Governmental entities, and to ensure a gender balance.
Objective 2
Enhance the role of decision-makers in the Arab Gulf region and the international community to build their capacities in the field of supporting women's contributions to the peace building process:  Conduct advanced trainings and technical workshops on women’s contributions to targeted peacebuilding, convene training workshops for policy makers involved in developing and implementing peacebuilding policy, including UAE representatives and promote cross-country and regional collaboration; and exchange best practices
Objective 3
Relevant stakeholders are responsive to the security needs and priorities of women, and are understanding of women’s contributions to the field: peacekeeping and security sector staff of all levels, receive trainings on UNSCR 1325 and subsequent resolutions on WPS Agenda, UAE commitments to address all types of violence and how to effectively promote zero-tolerance of gender-based discrimination, sexual exploitation, and abuse.
Objective 4
A gender perspective is integrated in efforts on prevention of and countering violent extremism: Identifying and addressing early signs of radicalization and gendered strategies to deal with extremism within communities and supporting women’s leadership in PVE/CVE field through their inclusion as decision-makers within relevant ministries. 
A gender perspective integrated into emergency response and crisis management planning and implementation: Relevant ministries to emergency response and crisis management planning (including pandemic response) will establish WPS coordination mechanisms, ensure the gender perspective is successfully integrated into implementation of operation mandates across all levels (strategic, operation, and tactical), and ensure equal career opportunities by recruiting and training more women at all levels to serve as first responders.","To evaluate if the main and secondary objectives were reached, the Emirati NAP includes a number of outcomes that indicate the fulfillment of achievements, largely using qualitative metrics.
Objective 1
Women’s political participation in UAE is strengthened: Gender parity within the Ministry
of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, and other relevant entities is strengthened, and the percentage of women at senior-level positions within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, and other relevant entities is increased.

United Kingdom,"The 2023-2027 UK NAP was developed by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and the Ministry of Defense (MOD), and for the first time, includes input from the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice and the Northern Ireland Office. The NAP was developed in collaboration with civil society organizations, academics and parliamentarians. It outlines five strategic objectives that aim to cut across the four pillars of the WPS agenda (prevention, protection, participation and relief and recovery) (p.10). These include: decision-making; gender-based violence; humanitarian and crisis response; security and justice; and transnational threats. It also includes twelve focus countries, three more than the previous NAP (p.35). The NAP outlines a monitoring and evaluation framework that consists of strategic outcomes and draft indicators (p. 11). It does not include an allocated budget, but indicates that government departments fund work on WPS from their core budgets. Within this, the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF) aims to work towards 15% of CSSF fundings being spent on WPS programming (p.36), and £12.5million in new funding being allocated to Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict (PSVI) Programming (p.19). The UK’s fifth NAP is preceded by four others, adopted in 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018, respectively. Compared to the former iterations, the most recent NAP has adopted a broader approach to transnational threats. In the 2018 NAP, a large focus was preventing and countering violent extremism, however the most recent one expands on this to include climate change, cyber threats, and the proliferation of weapons, specifically Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) (p.29). Despite the commitment to considering gender perspectives across SALW policy, mentions of wider disarmament are missing in this NAP, particularly in reference to the consistent transfer and sale of arms from the UK to the Middle East, and more recently, Ukraine. Additionally, the NAP attempts to respond to a critique from civil society about the externalization of the WPS agenda, and discusses domestic strategies in more depth compared to former NAPs (p.8). However, it does not develop the operationalisation of a domestic WPS agenda, and the roles of the devolved governments and civil service of Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland, are not clear. While Northern Ireland is explicitly mentioned in the NAP – likely due to its recent history with violent conflict – Scotland and Wales are not cited. The four nations of the United Kingdom also have uneven capacities . England, Scotland and Wales, for example, have Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG) strategies, whereas Northern Ireland does not. Saying that, the WPS agenda in Wales and Scotland is not particularly institutionalised, and in Northern Ireland, the Assembly is not currently sitting, meaning that nothing can be adopted into law, nor can any political progress be made regarding WPS. These differences, combined with the fact that those responsible for implementing WPS (the MoD and Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office) are London-based, give the impression that the NAP is England-centric , which raises concerns about the prospect of domestic coherence around the plan. With regards to Northern Ireland, the NAP outlines how the UK seeks to champion and highlight expertise from women peacebuilders in Northern Ireland and continue to support the Women Mediators Across the Commonwealth (WMC) network (p.8, p.15). For context, the most recent history of armed conflict in the UK is the conflict in Northern Ireland, known as “The Troubles”, which occurred between the 1960s and 1990s. The signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 brought an end to it, with women playing a key role throughout the peace process, especially with the participation of the Northern Ireland Women’s Coalition in Track I negotiations. The agreement included a provision of securing women’s rights to full and equal political participation, with a focus on social inclusion, community development and the advancement of women in public life. The contribution of women and women’s organizations to peacebuilding has always been and remains significant, so the endorsement of women peacebuilders in the country is a welcome inclusion in the NAP. Nonetheless, the focus on Northern Ireland without similar attention to issues in Scotland and Wales risks falsely asserting the boundaries of WPS as a “conflict-centered” agenda rather than one that realizes gender equality in everyday life. The UK is a contributor to overseas military operations, including in Iraq and Sudan. As of 2022, the UK was among the top ten countries in the world for military spending as a share of GDP, as well as being among the top 10 arms exporters. The UK is also a major contributor to humanitarian aid, including being a contributing donor to the Women’s Peace and Humanitarian Fund, a global partnership that works to empower women in conflict zones and humanitarian crises. The UK is also a partner of the Call to Action on Protection from Gender-Based Violence in Emergencies, a multi-stakeholder initiative that aims to mitigate and provide accountability for gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies. In 2021, the UK was UN Women’s twelfth largest other resources and regular resources contributor, totalling USD $15.1million. At the multilateral level, the UK is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.",1986,15,2014,,"NAP Development 
The UK NAP is jointly owned by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and for the first time includes input from the Home Office, the Ministry of Justice and the Northern Ireland Office. It was also developed across government and in collaboration with UK experts from women’s rights organizations, as well as wider civil society, academics and parliamentarians. 
NAP Implementation 
The UK takes a whole-of-government approach to WPS. The majority of the UK WPS work is jointly led by FCDO and MOD. Existing UK expertise from the MOD Human Security Advisers and the PSVI Team of Experts will also provide support and guidance (p.11). Relatedly, the UK government will mainstream WPS capability so that there is collective awareness and responsibility across government for policy and programming. This will include a global training offering and investment in research on the gender dynamics of conflict (p.33).
The UK will also establish strategic partnerships, globally and domestically with civil society, women-led organizations, WROs and women peacebuilders in order to implement the NAP (p.32).
The UK will provide a cross-government WPS Helpdesk, which is a call-down facility that provides evidence-informed analysis on WPS issues. The aim is that it will support gender-sensitive conflict and security policy and programming, boosting the UK’s capacity to implement its NAP (p.34).
The UK will take a coordinated and strategic approach to working with like minded countries and partners to respond to belligerent state and non-state actors. It will prioritize bilateral relationships with such countries in order to build a global network to drive forward implementation of the WPS agenda (p.32). 
The UK also looks to build on past efforts on the multilateral stage, prioritizing alliances with NATO, OSCE, the AU and ASEAN, alongside the UN (p.32). These partnerships are intended to diminish the impact of the push back against gender equality and the rights of women.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
The UK Government will provide updates to parliament every two years on the NAP delivery plan and will ensure senior representation at the annual WPS APPG session on NAP progress (p.37). This will be supplemented by baseline study of UK WPS activity, with impact evaluations taking place after 1, 2.5, and 5 years. The UK has set out draft indicators but these will be finalized during the baseline evaluation after Year 1 (p.37). The UK Government will work with the WPS All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) and civil society to respond to concerns and scrutiny (p.37).
 WILPF 
The Gender Action for Peace and Security (GAPS) UK is the most prominent organization that worked to develop the NAP. It is a membership network of civil society organizations including WILPF UK. Generally, as articulated in their response to the 5th UK NAP, GAPS are pleased to see a more holistic approach adopted in the most recent NAP, but are concerned about implementation because of current government dynamics in the UK. WILPF UK contributed to the NAP process through GAPS UK.",The NAP implementation period is five years (2023-2027).,"The 2023-2027 NAP identifies five strategic outcomes which set the vision for the UK WPS implementation strategy. These strategic outcomes have been selected for their contributions to the four pillars of WPS, their relevance across the UK’s broader foreign, development, defence and security policies, the UK’s expertise and influence, and their ability to respond to emerging threats and the current global context. They include: 
(1) Decision-making: increasing women’s meaningful participation, leadership and representation in decision-making processes 
(2) Gender-based violence: preventing GBV, including conflict-related sexual violence, and supporting survivors to cope, recover and seek justice 
(3) Humanitarian and crisis response: supporting the needs of women and girls in crises and ensuring they can participate and lead in responses 
(4) Security and justice: increasing the accountability of security and justice actors to women and girls and ensuring they are responsive to their rights and needs
(5) Transnational threats: ensuring response to the needs of women and girls as part of the approach to transnational threats ","Strategic outcomes have a comprehensive set of actions assigned. These are outlined in Annex A of the NAP (p. 38-47). It goes through all five strategic objectives, and lists the priority, the commitment, and the organizational lead for the action.","The NAP currently only has draft indicators for each strategic objective, which will be finalized during the writing and publication of the Year 1 report. These indicators are split into ‘departmental’ and ‘focus countries’. Examples of these indicators are below: 
SO1: % of UK diplomatic roles held by a woman; % of peace agreements supported by the UK that secure gender provisions within the agreement or implementation plan; % of women politicians increases as a result of UK political leverage (p.39).
SO2: Number of people benefiting from GBV prevention or response through FCDO; number of women and girls being supported to access UK funded GBV services by country (p. 41). 
SO3: % of humanitarian programmes with an OECD DAC Gender Marker of 1 or 2; annual UK funding for humanitarian interventions which have been adapted to target women, girls and/including survivors of GBV (p. 42). 
SO4: % of UK security sector projects and programmes, including disarmament and defectors programmes; % of CRSV cases brought forward that lead to successful prosecution under domestic law (p. 43). 
SO5: % of CSSF and NCP cyber programmes accounting for diversity and gender equality considerations; % of programmes that address transnational security threats (p. 45). ","For the 2023-2027 NAP, the UK adopts a monitoring and evaluation process that is measured on a two-yearly basis across Government departments. It includes reports to parliament through external assessments. The UK has published draft indicators, but will use the evaluation process in a responsive way through the lifespan of the NAP, remaining open to findings of external reports and adjusting monitoring and evaluation processes as needed.","UK Government departments fund work on WPS from their core budgets, such as the FCO’s Global Britain Fund, and cross-government funds including CSSF. The CSSF aims to work towards 15% of CSSF fundings being spent on WPS programming (p.36), and £12.5million in new funding is being allocated to Preventing Sexual Violence in Conflict (PSVI) Programming (p.19). 
 ","The NAP minimally references SALW, noting that their diversion and misuse can fuel conflict and crime, with particular impacts on women and girls (p.29). However, there are no wider mentions of disarmament."
United States Of America,"The United States adopted its most recent Women, Peace and Security (WPS) National Action Plan (NAP) in October 2023, in the form of a WPS National Strategy. The Strategy is rooted in existing national legislation, the WPS Act of 2017, which mandates a government wide strategy on WPS (p.3). The core drafting team in the development of the NAP consisted of advisors from the Department of State’s Secretary’s Office of Global Women’s Issues, the Department of Defense’s Office of the Secretary of Defense Policy and Joint Staff, the Department of Homeland Security’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, and U.S. Agency for International Development’s (USAID) Bureau for Conflict Prevention and Stabilization (p.50). Civil society organizations, including members of the U.S. Civil Society Working Group on WPS, shared input into the strategy as well (p.50). The Strategy identifies five ‘Lines of Effort’ (LOE): participation; protection; relief, response and recovery; integration and institutionalization; and partnerships (p.4). The participation LOE aims to seek and support preparation and participation of women and girls in civil and political leadership and in institutions related to peace and security (p.4). The protection LOE promotes the protection of human rights of women and girls and responds to GBV (p.4). The relief, response and recovery LOE prioritizes gender-responsive policies and programs to support participation and leadership of women in US government responses to conflict, crises and disasters (p.4). The integration and institutionalization LOE seeks to integrate WPS principles across US policies and programmes (p.4). Finally, the partnerships LOE encourages partners to mainstream WPS principles and strengthen capacity to improve gender equality in processes and institutions connected to peace and security decision-making (p.4). The Strategy does not include an allocated budget, instead noting that the technical and financial contributions of implementation departments will submit their anticipated budgets at a later date (p.21). Additionally, the US NAP states that the government recognises the interconnectedness of domestic and international implementation of the WPS agenda, acknowledging the need to implement the WPS agenda ‘at home’ in order to build trust and encourage partner nations to implement similar priorities (p.5). The US National Strategy is preceded by three other NAPs, adopted in 2011, 2016, and 2019, for the periods 2011-2015, 2016-2018, and 2019-2023 respectively.",,43,,876.94B,"NAP Development 
The WPS Strategy does not indicate civil society inclusion in the development of the document.
WILPF was not involved in the development of the US WPS Strategy.
The WPS Strategy does not have a clear indication of which government actors were involved in the development of the Strategy. 
NAP Implementation
The WPS Strategy mentions civil society twice in Lines of Effort 3 and 4 (pp. 12-13), emphasizing that the sustainability of the Strategy will require the support of non-governmental entities and organizations, including civil society. However, the WPS Strategy does not specifically indicate how civil society will be included in the Strategy’s implementation. 
The WPS Strategy indicates that the key departments and agencies that will implement the Strategy include, but are not limited to, the Department of State (DoS), Department of Defense (DoD), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).  Each of these agencies have developed detailed implementation plans for WPS activities.
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
The WPS Strategy does not indicate civil society inclusion in the monitoring and evaluation of the Strategy. 
The WPS Strategy indicates that individual departments and agencies will be responsible for developing “measurable goals, benchmarks, and timetables for their WPS initiatives” (p. 15).
Further detail about this implementation is available in the relevant strategies for each agency.
Timeframe
The implementation period for the WPS Strategy is four years (2019-2023).",,"The WPS Strategy identifies “women’s political empowerment and equality … whereby women can meaningfully participate in preventing, mediating, and resolving conflict and countering terrorism, in ways that promote stable and lasting peace, including in conflict-affected areas” (p.5) as the overarching goal of the United States WPS Strategy: 
The WPS Strategy identifies the following three strategic objectives to work towards the above mentioned end state: 
Women are more prepared and increasingly able to participate in efforts that promote stable and lasting peace;
Women and girls are safer, better protected, and have equal access to government and private assistance programs, including from the United States, international partners, and host nations; and
United States and partner governments have improved institutionalization and capacity to ensure WPS efforts are sustainable and long-lasting.","The WPS Strategy identifies four “lines of effort” to help “synchronize and prioritize” (pp. 5-6) actions to achieve the three overarching strategic objectives: 
Line of Effort 1: Seek and support the preparation and meaningful participation of women around the world in decision-making processes related to conflict and crises;
Line of Effort 2: Promote the protection of women and girls’ human rights; access to humanitarian assistance; and safety from violence, abuse, and exploitation around the world;
Line of Effort 3: Adjust United States international programs to improve outcomes in equality for, and the empowerment of women; and
Line of Effort 4: Encourage partner governments to adopt policies, plans, and capacity to improve the meaningful participation of women in processes connected to peace and security and decision-making institutions.
Each line of effort has a corresponding goal, possible barriers to the implementation of the goal, and a strategic approach, broken down into multiple stages of implementation with corresponding activities: 1) All phases, 2) Preventing conflict and preparing for disasters, 3) Managing, mitigating, and resolving conflict and crisis, and 4) Post-conflict and post-crisis relief and recovery. For example, Line of Effort 1 listed above has the following activities included for all phases:
Encourage the increased, meaningful participation of women in security-sector initiatives funded by the United States Government, including programs that provide training to foreign nationals regarding law enforcement, the rule of law, and professional military education. United States courses that historically attract only male international students from certain countries or regions should consider ways to incentivize the inclusion of female students as well.
Integrate women’s perspectives and interests into conflict prevention, conflict-resolution, and post conflict peace-building activities and strategies, including women from under-represented groups, via consultation with local women leaders in the design, implementation, and evaluation of United States initiatives;
Encourage the inclusion of women leaders and women’s organizations in the prevention and resolution of conflict, and in post-conflict peace-building efforts. Where appropriate, United States diplomatic, military, and development interventions will lead by example through inclusion of American women in such efforts, and will engage local women leaders as vital partners, including through support that advances their meaningful political participation and empowerment, capacity, credibility, and professional development; and
Use relevant analysis and indicators, including the collection of sex-disaggregated data, to identify and address barriers to women’s meaningful participation in the prevention and resolution of conflict, and in post-conflict peace-building efforts and programs, including early warning systems related to conflict and violence.","The WPS Strategy does not identify specific indicators other than stating that the “Administration will commit to rigorously track and report on metrics across the interagency on an annual basis” (p. 15).
Indicators are provided in the departmental implementation plans that were mandated by the 2017 WPS Act.
The WPS Strategy does not identify specific indicators for the strategic objectives either, with the exception of mentioning examples of indicators for one of the illustrative activities of Line of Effort 1, which reads:   
“Use relevant analysis and indicators, including the collection of sex-disaggregated data, to identify and address barriers to women’s meaningful participation in the prevention and resolution of conflict, and in post-conflict peace-building efforts and programs, including early warning systems related to conflict and violence” (p. 8).
Monitoring and Evaluation
The WPS Strategy tasks individual departments and agencies with developing “measurable goals, benchmarks, and timetables” (p. 15). The Strategy identifies an overarching, multi-tier timeline for the overall implementation of the US WPS Strategy: 
No later than 90 days after this Strategy goes into effect, departments and agencies will nominate criteria to the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs (APNSA) for inclusion in a United States Government-wide WPS framework for monitoring and evaluating programs. 
Within 120 days of the approval of this WPS Strategy, State, DOD, DHS, and USAID shall each develop, in coordination with the APNSA and Office of Management and Budget, and provide to the Congress a detailed, consolidated implementation plan. 
Not later than 1 year after submission of this strategy, the Secretary of State, in conjunction with the Secretary of Defense and the Administrator of USAID, shall brief the appropriate Congressional Committees on existing, enhanced, or newly established training for relevant United States personnel on the participation of women in conflict-prevention and peace building.
Not later than 2 years after submission of this strategy, the Secretary of State, in conjunction with the Secretary of Defense and the Administrator of USAID shall submit to the APNSA, and be prepared to brief the appropriate Congressional Committees on, a report that summarizes and evaluates departments’ and agencies’ implementation plans; describes the nature and extent of interagency coordination on implementation; outlines the monitoring and evaluation on policy objectives; and describes existing, enhanced, or newly established training.",,"There is a section on resourcing, which indicates that resources will be allocated to each department and agency for the implementation of the strategy.","The WPS Strategy acknowledges that armed conflicts have a unique and “disproportionate, adverse impact” on women and girls (p. 5). Nevertheless, despite the US position as a leader in global arms trade and military spending, the revised WPS Strategy does not discuss disarmament or demilitarization of the country’s budget."
Uruguay,,1981,72,2014,1.200B,"Development
The Interinstitutional Working Group, created by Ministerial Resolution 296/20 on July 29th, 2020, developed the NAP. It included personnel from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Interior Ministry, the National Defense Ministry, the Human Rights Secretariat, and the Women’s National Institute; it was supported by staff from Inclusive Security and UN Women.
Implementation
The Foreign Affairs Ministry, National Defense Ministry, Interior Ministry, Human Rights Secretariat, and the Women’s National Institute in the Social Development Ministry are responsible for the implementation of the NAP. 
Monitoring and Evaluation
The Interinstitutional Working Group that created the NAP is responsible for monitoring and evaluation as well.
Civil Society Organizations
The Interinstitutional Working Group that formulated the NAP is not reported to have included the participation of CSOs, although there are some mentions of CSOs throughout the document.",The timeframe for the implementation of the NAP is from 2021 to 2024.,"Due to the Uruguayan national experience as well as the principles that led their foreign policy, and their participation in international organizations, three objectives were outlined for the NAP.
Promote a gender perspective in all peace and security activities.
Promote a focus on human security, with a gender perspective.
Strengthen the capacity for responsiveness on the international level in relation to the WPS agenda and Protection of Civilians in Peace Operations, in order to make societies more fair, peaceful, and inclusive.","The NAP outlines a number of proposed actions and activities, which span across the four pillars of the WPS agenda. 
As the participation of Uruguay in Peacekeeping Operations is a key element of their foreign policy, there are several proposed actions to include the WPS agenda in this work, including:
Increasing women’s participation in Peacekeeping operations
Developing specific actions to overcome obstacles and increase women’s participation in Peacekeeping Operations and public life.
Broadcasting Uruguay’s experiences, lessons, and good practices in Peacekeeping Operations
Promoting humanitarian and human rights focus on civil society protection in Uruguay, particularly in the context of armed conflict.
The WPS agenda is considered a key topic for international cooperation and Uruguay seeks to promote it through its foreign policy, with actions such as:
Promote conflict resolution and conflict prevention abilities and capabilities in international fora, like the participation in the Network of Women Mediators of the Southern Cone.
Promote regional and international initiatives about the WPS agenda. 
Sharing experiences and good practices on the WPS agenda with regional and international partners, including gender equality, GBV prevention, and the WPS agenda in bilateral dialogue and promoting the WPS agenda through active participation in regional and international forums 
At the national level, Uruguay’s NAP is focused on: 
Promoting the WPS agenda at the national level for all Government institutions, through the promotion of courses on Gender-awareness for the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Interior, the provision of  education on WPS and other related issues within the Government personnel, and the incorporation of training and qualification on the WPS agenda for diplomats and members of the MFA
Include gender analysis in all State activities related to peace and security
Promote the human security focus with a gender perspective in government institutions.
Promote the WPS agenda at the national level through the broadcasting of the NAP through a media plan and the promotion of activities about the WPS agenda in the International Relations major in Uruguay’s Universities.
Promote cybersecurity with a gender perspective among youth","To ensure the implementation of the Action Plan, Uruguay proposes a series of means of verification as key indicators of the execution of the proposed actions. Due to the wide spectrum of activities proposed, the means of verification are also diverse, and include: 
the minutes of activities carried out, such as conferences, workshops, bilateral and multilateral meetings, etc; the lists of training attendees and graduates of courses, trainings and workshops; the number of research articles on WPS published between 2021 and 2024, the number of spots or advertising campaigns focused on the diffusion of the WPS at the national level, the number of reports of the implementation of the NAP, etc.","The Interinstitutional Working Group, who is the responsible actor for the M&E of the implementation of the NAP, has three main tools to realize such task:
The digital platform SIMORE will be used to evaluate the implementation of the planned actions and their short-term results. On this platform it is possible to establish the activities for all government levels and the timeframe to execute them, and as the information is provided by local authorities, it facilitates reporting. 
Mid-term reports will be delivered every six months, as a result of the follow up of the Interinstitutional Working Group on the implementation of the NAP.
A final report will be further used to structure the next NAP for Uruguay.","There is no specific financing or budget for each activity, as each Government office is responsible to realize their activities with their general budget, however, the NAP states that the MFA must identify extra funding opportunities.","Although there are no specific proposals on disarmament, Uruguay considers that the support to disarmament mechanisms is a key principle of their national defense policy that also supports the Uruguayan Foreign Policy, along with the support for the maintaining of international peace and security, the proscription of the threat or use of force, the peaceful settlement of disputes, and support for dialogue and peace.  "
Yemen,"Yemen adopted its first National Action Plan (NAP) in December 2019 for the period 2020-2022. The NAP was developed by a number of government ministries, with the involvement of civil society and UN agencies in developing, drafting, and reviewing the NAP. This consultative process included an initial three-day workshop to formulate the goals and framework of the NAP. The NAP’s four overarching objectives, which are grouped under participation, prevention, protection, and relief and recovery, reflect the pillars of UNSCR 1325. The NAP is contextualized by how the war in Yemen has decimated the economy, led to widespread displacement and an increase in poverty, and created a dire humanitarian situation, which affects civilians, including women and girls. The document describes the differential impacts of the conflict on women and girls and their human rights, including on issues such as sexual and gender-based violence, child marriage, education, health, and the right to live in dignity, safety, and stability as well as contextualizing these issues within the framework of international human rights and humanitarian law. The most recent history of armed conflict in Yemen’s history is the country’s civil war, which has been ongoing since 2014. The current situation in Yemen has been described as the “world’s worst humanitarian crisis.” An estimated 24 million people (80% of the population) rely on humanitarian assistance to survive, over 100,000 people have been killed over five years of war, and 4 million people have been displaced . Conflict parties have engaged in arbitrary detention, including of human rights activists and journalists, enforced disappearance, and torture, including sexual violence. All parties to the conflict have violated international humanitarian law, including bombing civilian infrastructure and residential areas. Restrictions and delays on humanitarian access have inhibited the ability for people to access the food and medical assistance they need. The war in Yemen is being fueled by the involvement of international actors and the influx of arms from abroad. WILPF and partner research has identified that arms transfers from countries including the United States, United Kingdom, Sweden, Canada, and Germany have been linked to human rights abuses in Yemen and have contributed to a rise in gender-based violence. In addition to being in the forefront of the 2011 uprisings in Yemen, women have played a key role throughout the war through delivering humanitarian response as well as conducting mediation and peacebuilding efforts.",1984,153,,,"NAP Development
The NAP states that civil society participated in the development of the NAP, including in the initial workshop to formulate the initial concept for the NAP and the drafting and review process. A full list of all entities that were involved in the NAP development is listed in an appendix (pg. 15). 
A number of government ministries were involved in different stages of the process of developing the NAP, including workshops, consultative discussions, and the technical drafting and review team. The full list of agencies who were involved in the different stages of the process is listed in the appendices. The technical team consisted of representatives of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor, the Yemeni Women Union and Women National Committee. Missing from this was the office of the National Dialogue Minister.
NAP Implementation
An implementation matrix (starting on pg. 17) identifies the stakeholders responsible for each stage of implementation of the NAP. NGOs are identified as responsible actors for a range of activities within the implementation matrix. For example, one activity for which NGOs are identified as responsible for implementation is “preparing studies and research on violence against women and girls, and on sexual violence in conflicts” (pg. 21).
The implementation matrix identifies the stakeholders responsible for each stage of implementation of the NAP. Most of this responsibility lies with different ministries in the Government of Yemen including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Human Rights, and Ministry of Defense. 
NAP Monitoring and Evaluation
The NAP states that the monitoring and evaluation process will involve all government agencies and NGOs that are responsible for carrying out the activities outlined in the NAP.
The Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor is responsible for setting up follow-up and evaluation mechanisms for the NAP (pg. 14), and the NAP states that the monitoring and evaluation process will involve all government agencies and NGOs that are responsible for carrying out the activities outlined in the NAP.",The implementation period for the NAP is 2 years (2020-2021).,"The NAP contains four main strategic objectives, which align with the pillars of the Women, Peace and Security agenda:
To enhance women's participation at all levels in decision-making positions.
To ensure the prevention of conflicts and all forms of sexual violence, extremism and terrorism.
To enhance the protection of women from all forms of violence.
To provide women with their humanitarian needs during and post-conflict, in gender-sensitive ways.","The NAP has an implementation matrix which outlines outputs, interventions/activities, indicators, actors responsible for implementation, and timeframe for each output. Each of the strategic objectives of the NAP has a number of outputs and indicators. For example, the activity “involving women in peace negotiations to at least 30%” (pg. 17) is accompanied by an indicator “percentage of women’s participation in peace negotiations”, the responsible actors are the Cabinet and the United Nations, and the timeframe is the duration of the NAP (2020-2022). ","The NAP identifies several indicators for each objective, outlined in the implementation matrix. For example, under the participation outcome, indicators include “Percentage of women’s participation in peace negotiations” and “increase in the percentage of women in decision making positions” (pg. 17).","There is minimal detail provided in the NAP regarding monitoring and evaluation mechanisms. The Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor is responsible for setting up follow-up and evaluation mechanisms for the NAP (pg. 14), and the NAP states that the monitoring and evaluation process will involve all government agencies and NGOs that are responsible for carrying out the activities outlined in the NAP. The Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor is also responsible for forming the programming and activities to achieve the required goals of the NAP, and it is stated that  “these goals are subject  to evaluation and development considering new developments.”",The NAP does not mention a budget.,"The relief and recovery outcome of the NAP includes activities to include women in disarmament programs, with the associated indicator of the number of women in disarmament programming (pg. 25)."
